["Electrochemistry is the study of production of\nelectricity from energy released during spontaneous\nchemical reactions  and the use of electrical energy\nto bring about non-spontaneous chemical\ntransformations. The subject is of importance both\nfor theoretical and practical considerations. A large\nnumber of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine,\nfluorine and many other chemicals are produced by\nelectrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells\nconvert chemical energy into electrical energy and are\nused on a large scale in various instruments and\ndevices. The reactions carried out electrochemically\ncan be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore,\nstudy of electrochemistry is important for creating new\ntechnologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of\nsensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa\nand communication between the cells are known to\nhave electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is\ntherefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject.

In this device the Gibbs energy  of the spontaneous\nredox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for\nrunning a motor or other electrical gadgets  like heater , fan,\ngeyser , etc.\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following\nredox reaction occurs.\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) \u00ae Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition\ngives the overall cell reaction:\n(i)Cu2+   +  2e\u2013    \u00ae Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)\n(ii)Zn(s)  \n\u00ae Zn2+ + 2e\u2013(oxidation half reaction) (2.3)\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.\nThe reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the\noxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions\nof the cell are also called half-cells  or redox couples . The copper\nelectrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,\nthe oxidation half-cell.\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the patter n\nof Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-\ncell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two\nhalf-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a\nswitch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected\ninternally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1.  Sometimes, both\nthe electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we\ndo not require a salt bridge.\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal\nions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make\nit positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode\nhave a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the\nelectrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At\nequilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the\ntendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively\nor negatively charged with  respect to the solution. A potential difference\ndevelops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called\nelectrode potential . When the concentrations of all the species involved\nin a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard\nelectrode potential . According to IUPAC convention, standard\nreduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a\ngalvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode\nand it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other\nhalf-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a\npositive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a\npotential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the\nswitch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode\nto positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of\nelectron flow.2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells2.2 Galvanic Cells\nReprint 2025-26\n", "34 ChemistryThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic\ncell is called the cell potential  and is measured in volts. The cell\npotential  is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction\npotentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive\nforce (emf)  of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It\nis now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and\nthe cathode on the right  while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic\ncell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal\nand electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between\nthe two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge.  Under this convention\nthe emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-\ncell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the\nleft hand side i.e. ,\nEcell = Eright  \u2013 Eleft\nThis is illustrated by the following example:\nCell reaction:\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) \u00be\u00ae Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)\nHalf-cell reactions:\nCathode (reduction ):   2Ag+(aq) + 2e\u2013 \u00ae 2Ag(s) (2.5)\nAnode ( oxidation ):    Cu(s)  \u00ae Cu2+(aq) + 2e\u2013(2.6)\nIt can be seen that  the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to  overall reaction\n(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper\nelectrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:\nCu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)\nand we have \nEcell = Eright \u2013 Eleft = EAg+\u00faAg \u2013 ECu2+\u00faCu(2.7)\nThe potential of individual half-cell cannot be measur ed. W e can\nmeasure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that\ngives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one\nelectrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect\nto this. According to convention, a half-cell\ncalled standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)\nrepresented by Pt(s) \u00fa H2(g)\u00fa H+(aq), is assigned\na zero potential at all temperatures\ncorresponding to the reaction\n    H+ (aq) + e\u2013  \u00ae  1\n2H2(g)\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists\nof a platinum electrode coated with platinum\nblack. The electrode is dipped in an acidic\nsolution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled\nthrough it.  The concentration of both the\nreduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is\nmaintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies\nthat the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar\nand the concentration of hydrogen ion in the\nsolution is one molar .2.2.1\nMeasurement\nof Electrode\nPotential\nFig. 2.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE).\nReprint 2025-26\n", "35 ElectrochemistryAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode \u00e7\u00e7second\nhalf-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode\n(reference half-cell) and the other half-cell  as cathode, gives the reduction\npotential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and\nthe reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity,\nthen the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential,  Eo\nR of\nthe given half-cell.\nEo = Eo\nR \u2013 Eo\nL\nAs Eo\nL for standard hydrogen electrode is zero.\nEo = Eo\nR \u2013 0 = Eo\nR\nThe measured emf of the cell:\nPt(s) \u00e7\n H2(g, 1 bar)  \u00e7 H+ (aq, 1 M) \u00e7\u00e7 Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) \u00fa Cu\nis 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential\nof the half-cell corresponding to the reaction:\nCu2+ (aq, 1M) + 2 e\u2013  \u00ae  Cu(s)\nSimilarly, the measured emf of the cell:\nPt(s) \u00e7 H2(g, 1 bar)  \u00e7 H+ (aq, 1 M)  \u00e7\u00e7 Zn2+ (aq, 1M)  \u00e7 Zn\nis -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the\nhalf-cell reaction:\nZn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2e\u2013 \u00ae  Zn(s)\nThe positive  value of the standard electrode potential in the first\ncase indicates that Cu2+ ions get reduced more easily than H+ ions. The\nreverse pr ocess cannot occur , that is, hydr ogen ions cannot oxidise Cu\n(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)\nunder the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not\ndissolve in HCl.  In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by\nhydrogen ion.  The negative value of the standard electrode potential\nin the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or\nzinc can reduce hydrogen ions).\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in\nFig. 2.1 can be written as:\nLeft electrode: Zn(s) \u00ae Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e\u2013\nRight electrode: Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e\u2013 \u00ae Cu(s)\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions\nand we obtain the equation:\nZn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) \u00ae Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\nemf of the cell = Eo\ncell= Eo\nR \u2013 Eo\nL\n= 0.34V \u2013 (\u2013 0.76)V = 1.10 V\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.\nThey do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for\noxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.\nFor example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:\nHydrogen electrode:  Pt(s)|H2(g)| H+(aq)\nWith half-cell reaction:  H+ (aq)+ e\u2013 \u00ae \u00bd H2(g)\nBromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br2(aq)| Br\u2013(aq)\nReprint 2025-26\n", "36 ChemistryWith half-cell reaction: \u00bd Br2(aq) + e\u2013 \u00ae Br\u2013(aq)\nThe standard electrode potentials are very important and we can\nextract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard\nelectrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are\ngiven in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode\nis greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to\nhydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative\nthen hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.\nIt can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the\nhighest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2) has the maximum\ntendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F\u2013) and therefore fluorine\ngas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest\nreducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating\nthat lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is\nthe most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be\nseen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard\nelectrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising\npower of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of\nthe species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical\ncells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility\nproduct, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties\nand for potentiometric titrations.\nIntext QuestionsIntext QuestionsIntext QuestionsIntext QuestionsIntext Questions\n2.1How would you determine the standard electrode potential of the system\nMg2+|Mg?\n2.2Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot?\n2.3Consult the table of standard electrode potentials and suggest three\nsubstances that can oxidise ferrous ions under suitable conditions.\n2.3 2.32.3 2.32.3 NernstNernstNernst NernstNernst\nEquation EquationEquation EquationEquationWe have assumed in the pr evious section that the concentration of all\nthe species involved in the electrode reaction is unity.

The law states that limiting\nmolar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the\nindividual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte . Thus,\nif l\u00b0\nNa+ and l\u00b0\nCl\u2013 are limiting molar  conductivity  of the sodium and chloride\nions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride\nis given by the equation:\nL\u00b0m (NaCl) = l\u00b0\nNa+ + l\u00b0\nCl\u2013 (2.24)\nIn general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives n+ cations and n\u2013\nanions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by:\nL\u00b0m  = n+ l\u00b0\n+ + n\u2013 l\u00b0\n\u2013(2.25)\nHere, l\u00b0\n+ and l\u00b0\n\u2013 are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation\nand anion respectively.

In such cases Lm increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on\ndilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, L\u00b0m  cannot be\nobtained by extrapolation of Lm to zero concentration.

If the electrode is\ninert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical\nreaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons.

Corrosion of iron\n(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of\nwater and air . The chemistry of corr osion is quite\ncomplex but it may be considered\nessentially as an electrochemical\nphenomenon.

It not only saves\nmoney but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse\nor failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest\nmethods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic\nobject to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering\nthe surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another\nsimple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that\nare inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to\nprovide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which\ncorrodes itself but saves the object.2.8 2.82.82.82.8Corrosion\nCorrosionCorrosion CorrosionCorrosion\nReprint 2025-26\n", "58 Chemistry\nThe Hydrogen EconomyThe Hydrogen EconomyThe Hydrogen EconomyThe Hydrogen EconomyThe Hydrogen Economy\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels\nsuch as coal, oil and gas.

Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water\nand hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And\nboth these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.Intext QuestionsIntext QuestionsIntext QuestionsIntext QuestionsIntext Questions\n2.13 Write the chemistry of r echar ging the lead storage battery, highlighting\nall the materials that are involved during recharging.\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in\nfuel cells.\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an\nelectrochemical cell.\nSummary SummarySummary SummarySummary\nAn electrochemical cell  consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic\nsolution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic\nconductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell ,\nthe chemical  energy  of a spontaneous redox reaction  is converted into electrical\nwork, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-\nspontaneous redox reaction . The standard electrode potential  for any electrode\ndipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode\npotential of hydrogen electrode  taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell\ncan be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and\nanode (( )o\ncellE  = Eocathode  \u2013 Eoanode ). The standard potential of the cells are\nrelated to standard Gibbs energy ( DrGo = \u2013 nF( )o\ncellE ) and equilibrium constant\n(DrGo = \u2013 RT ln K) of the r eaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence\nof the potentials of the  electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.\nThe conductivity , k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration\nof the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity , Lm, is\ndefined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar\nconductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with\ndecrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep\nfor weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar\nconductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the\nReprint 2025-26\n", "59 Electrochemistry\nmolar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of\nindependent migration of ions  and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity\nthrough the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the\nelectrodes in an electrochemical cell.
