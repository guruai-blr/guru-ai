["Unit 6\nEqUilibri Um\nChemical equilibria are important in numerous biological \nand environmental processes. For example, equilibria involving O\n2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play \na crucial role in the transport and delivery of O2 from \nour lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO molecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.\nWhen a liquid evaporates in a closed container, \nmolecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape the liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of liquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid surface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise to a constant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium  in \nwhich the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the number returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that the system has reached equilibrium state at this stage. However, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of activity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour. Thus, at equilibrium , the rate of evaporation is equal to the \nrate of condensation. It may be represented by\nH\n2O (l)   H2O (vap)\nThe double half arrows indicate that the processes \nin both the directions are going on simultaneously. The mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an equilibrium mixture.\nEquilibrium can be established for both physical \nprocesses and chemical reactions. The reaction may be fast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and the nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed vessel at a particular temperature react to give products, the concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing, while those of products keep on increasing for some time after which there is no change in the concentrations \nof either of the reactants or products. This stage of the system is the dynamic equilibrium and the rates of the \nforward and reverse reactions become equal.

Based on the extent to which the reactions proceed to reach the state of chemical equilibrium,  these may \nbe classified in three groups.\n(i)\n The reactions that proceed nearly \nto compl\netion and only negligible \nconcentrations of the reactants are left.

Some important aspects of equilibrium involving physical and chemical processes are dealt in this unit along with the equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solutions which is called as ionic equilibrium.\n6.1\n EqUilibri Um in PHYS iCAl \nPrOCESSES\nThe characteristics of system \nat equilibrium \nare better understood if we examine some \nphysical processes. The most familiar examples are phase transformation processes , e.g.,\n solid        liquid \n liquid        gas\n solid         gas\n6.1.1  Solid- liquid Equilibrium\nIce and water kept in a perfectly insulated thermos flask \n(no exchange of heat between its \ncontents and the surroundings) at 273K and \nthe atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium state and the system shows interesting characteristic features. We observe that the \nmass of ice and water do not change with time and the temperature remains constant. However, the equilibrium is not static. The intense activity can be noticed at the boundary between ice and water. Molecules from the liquid water collide against ice and adhere to it and some molecules of ice escape into liquid phase. There is no change of mass of ice and water, as the rates of transfer of molecules from ice into water and of reverse transfer from water into ice are equal at atmospheric pressure and 273 K. \nIt is obvious that ice and water are in \nequilibrium only at particular temperature \nand pressure. For any pure substance at \natmospheric pressure, the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases are at equilibrium is called the normal melting point or normal freezing point of the substance .  The \nsystem here is in dynamic equilibrium and we can infer the following:(i)\n Both the opposing processes occur simultaneously.\n(ii)\n Both the processes occur at the same rate \nso that the amount of ice and water \nremains constant.\n6.1.2  liquid-Vapour Equilibrium\nThis equilibrium can be better understood if \nwe consider the example of a transparent box carrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer).\n \nDrying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride (or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for a few hours in the box. After removing the drying agent by tilting the box on one side, a watch glass (or petri dish) containing water is quickly placed inside the box. It will be observed that the mercury level in the right limb of the manometer slowly increases and finally attains a constant value, that is, the pressure inside the box increases and reaches a constant value. Also the volume of water in the watch glass decreases (Fig. 6.1). Initially there was no water vapour (or very less) inside the box. As water evaporated the pressure in the box increased due to addition of water \nmolecules into the gaseous phase inside the box. The rate of evaporation is constant. \nUnit 6.indd   169 9/12/2022   11:58:20 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "170\nchemistry\nHowever, the rate of increase in pressure \ndecreases with time due to condensation of vapour into water. Finally it leads to an equilibrium condition when there is no net evaporation. This implies that the number of water molecules from the gaseous state into the liquid state also increases till the equilibrium is attained i.e.,\nrate of evaporation= rate of condensation\nH\n2O(l)          H2O (vap)\nAt equilibrium the pressure exerted by \nthe water molecules at a given temperature remains constant and is called the equilibrium vapour pressure of water (or just vapour pressure of water); vapour pressure of water increases with temperature. If the above experiment is repeated with methyl alcohol, acetone and ether, it is observed that different liquids have different equilibrium vapour pressures at the same temperature, and the liquid which has a higher vapour pressure is more volatile and has a lower boiling point. \nIf we expose three watch glasses containing \nseparately 1mL each of acetone, ethyl alcohol, and water to atmosphere and repeat the experiment with different volumes of the liquids in a warmer room, it is observed that in all such cases the liquid eventually disappears and the time taken for complete evaporation depends on (i) the nature of the liquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the temperature. When the watch glass is open to the atmosphere, the rate of evaporation remains constant but the molecules are \ndispersed into large volume of the room. As a consequence the rate of condensation from vapour to liquid state is much less than the \nrate of evaporation. These are open systems and it is not possible to reach equilibrium in an open system.\nWater and water vapour are in equilibrium \nposition at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar) and at 100\u00b0C in a closed vessel. The boiling point of water is 100\u00b0C at 1.013 bar pressure. For any pure liquid at one atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar), the temperature at which the liquid and vapours are at equilibrium is called normal boiling point of the liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends on the atmospheric pressure. It depends on the altitude of the place; at high altitude the boiling point decreases. \n6.1.3\n Solid \u2013 Vapour Equilibrium\nLet us now consider the systems where solids \nsublime \nto vapour phase. If we place solid \niodine in a closed vessel, after sometime the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour and the intensity of colour increases with time. After certain time the intensity of colour becomes constant and at this stage equilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine sublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine vapour condenses to give solid iodine. The equilibrium can be represented as,\nI\n2(solid)   I2 (vapour)\nOther examples showing this kind of \nequilibrium are,\nCamphor (solid)  Camphor (vapour)\nNH4Cl (solid)   NH4Cl (vapour)Fig. 6.1  Measuring equilibrium vapour pressure of water at a constant temperature\nUnit 6.indd   170 9/12/2022   11:58:21 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "171\nEQUILIBRIUM\n6.1.4  Equilibrium Involving Dissolution \nof Solid or Gases in Liquids\nSolids in liquids\nWe know f\nrom our experience that we can \ndissolve only a limited amount of salt or \nsugar in a given amount of water at room temperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup solution by dissolving sugar at a higher temperature, sugar crystals separate out if we cool the syrup to the room temperature. We call it a saturated solution when no more of solute can be dissolved in it at a given  temperature. The concentration of the solute in a saturated solution depends upon the temperature. In a saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium exits between the solute molecules in the solid state and in the solution:\nSugar (solution) \n Sugar (solid), and \nthe rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of \ncrystallisation of sugar.\nEquality of the two rates and dynamic \nnature of equilibrium has been confirmed with \nthe help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some radioactive sugar into saturated solution of non-radioactive sugar, then after some time radioactivity is observed both in the solution and in the solid sugar. Initially there were no radioactive sugar molecules in the solution but due to dynamic nature of equilibrium, there is exchange between the radioactive and non-radioactive sugar molecules between the two phases. The ratio of the radioactive to non-radioactive molecules in the solution increases till it attains a constant value.\nGases in liquids\nWhen a soda water bottle is opened, some of \nthe carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes out rapidly. The phenomenon arises due to difference in solubility of carbon dioxide at different pressures. There is equilibrium between the molecules in the gaseous state and the molecules dissolved in the liquid \nunder pressure i.e.,\nCO\n2 (gas)  CO2 (in solution)\nThis equilibrium is governed by Henry\u2019s \nlaw, which states that the mass of a gas \ndissolved in a given mass of a solvent at any temperature is proportional to the  pressure of the gas above the solvent.  \nThis amount decreases with increase of temperature. The soda water bottle is sealed under pressure of gas when its solubility in water is high. As soon as the bottle is opened, some of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas escapes to reach a new equilibrium condition required for the lower pressure, namely its partial pressure in the atmosphere. This is how the soda water in bottle when left open \nto the air for some time, turns \u2018flat\u2019. It can be generalised that:\n(i)\n For solid  liquid equilibrium, there is \nonly one temperature (melting point) at  \n1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two \nphases can coexist. If there is no exchange of heat with the surroundings, the mass of the two phases remains constant.\n(ii)\n For liquid  vapour equilibrium, the \nvapour pressure is constant at a given temperature.\n(iii)\n For dissolution of solids in liquids, the solubili\nty is constant at a given \ntemperature.\n(iv) For dissolution of gases in liquids, the concentration of \na gas in liquid \nis proportional to the pressure (concentration) of the gas over the liquid.

Table 6.1 lists such quantities.\n(v)\n The magnitude of such quantities at any stage indicates the extent to which the physical process has proceeded before reaching equilibrium.\n6.2\n EQUILIBRIUM IN CHEMICAL PROCESSES \u2013 DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM\nAnalogous to the physical systems chemical reactions also attain a state of equilibrium. These reactions can occur both in forward\n \nand backward directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal, the concentrations of the reactants and the products remain constant. This is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This equilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists of a forward reaction in which the reactants give product(s) and reverse reaction in which product(s) gives the original reactants.\nFor a better comprehension, let us consider \na general case of a reversible reaction, \nA + B \n C + D\nWith passage of time, there is \naccumulation of the products C and D and \ndepletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 6.2).  \nThis leads to a decrease in the rate of forward reaction and an increase in the rate of the reverse reaction,Fig. 6.2  Attainment of chemical equilibrium.\nEventually, the two reactions occur at the \nsame rate and the system reaches a state of \nequilibrium. \nSimilarly, the reaction can reach the state \nof equilibrium even if we start with only C and D; that is, no A and B being present initially, as the equilibrium can be reached from either direction.\nThe dynamic nature of chemical \nequilibrium can be demonstrated in the synthesis of ammonia by Haber\u2019s process.  In a series of experiments, Haber started with known amounts of dinitrogen and dihydrogen maintained at high temperature and pressure and at regular intervals determined the amount of ammonia present. He was successful in determining also the concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and dinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after a certain time the composition of the mixture remains the same even though some of the reactants are still present. This constancy in composition indicates that the reaction has reached equilibrium. In order to understand the dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis of ammonia is carried out with exactly the same starting conditions (of partial pressure and temperature) but using D\n2 (deuterium) \nin place of H2. The reaction mixtures starting \neither with H2 or D2 reach equilibrium with \nthe same composition, except that D2 and \nND3 are present instead of H2 and NH3.

This can \nbe demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.\nTake two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of \n30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. \nPut one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, \nclose its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2\nnd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner \nfrom cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant.\nIf you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be \nany further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of \u2018level\u2019 of coloured water with \u2018concentration\u2019 of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning. \nFig.6.3\t Demonstrating\n\tdynamic \tnature\tof\tequilibrium. \t(a)\tinitial\tstage\t(b)\tfinal\tstage\tafter\tthe\t\nequilibrium is attained.1 2 1 2\n(a) (b)\nUnit 6.indd   173 9/12/2022   11:58:21 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "174\nchemistry\n2NH3(g)  N2(g) + 3H2(g) \nSimilarly let us consider the reaction,  \nH2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g).

We can also start with HI alone and make the reaction to proceed in the reverse direction; the concentration of HI will decrease and concentration of H\n2 and I2 will increase until \nthey all become constant when equilibrium is reached (Fig. 6.5).

Thus one can \nconclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in the molecules must result from a continuation of the forward and reverse reactions in the mixture. If the reaction had simply stopped when they reached equilibrium, then there would have been no mixing of isotopes in this way.\nUse of isotope (deuterium) in the formation \nof ammonia clearly indicates that chemical \nreactions reach a state of dynamic equilibrium in which the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal and there is no net change in composition.   \nEquilibrium can be attained from both \nsides, whether we start reaction by taking, H\n2(g) and N2(g) and get NH3(g) or by taking \nNH3(g) and decomposing it into N2(g) and H2(g).\nN2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g)  Fig. 6.5  Chemical  equilibrium in the reaction H2(g) \n+ I2(g)  2HI(g) can be attained from \neither directionFig. 6.4  Depic\ntion of equilibrium for the reaction\n6.3 lAW OF CHE miCAl EqUilibri Um \nAnD EqUilibri Um COnStAnt\nA mixture of reactants and products in the \nequilibrium state is called an equilibrium\n \nmixture.

The \nlast question in particular is important when choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial chemicals such as H\n2, NH3, CaO etc.\nTo answer these questions, let us consider \na general reversible reaction:\nA + B  C + D\nwhere A and B are the reactants, C and D are the products in the balanced chemical equation. On the basis of experimental studies of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the concentrations in an equilibrium mixture are related by the following equilibrium equation, \n Kc/unif03d/unif05b/unif05d/unif05b/unif05d\n/unif05b/unif05d/unif05b/unif05dCD\nAB                (6.1)\n  \n(6.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant and \nthe expression on the right side is called the equilibrium constant expression .\nThe equilibrium equation is also known as \nthe law of mass action because in the early \ndays of chemistry, concentration was called \u201cactive mass\u201d. In order to appreciate their work better, let us consider reaction between gaseous H\n2 and I2 carried out in a sealed vessel \nat 731K.\n H2(g)   +   I2(g) \uf020\uf020  2HI(g)\n 1 mol    1 mol          2 molSix sets of \nexperiments with varying initial \nconditions were performed, starting with only \ngaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel \nin first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and only HI in other two experiments (5 and 6). Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed taking different concentrations of H\n2 and / or \nI2, and with time it was observed that intensity \nof the purple colour remained constant and equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was attained from the opposite direction.\nData obtained from all six sets of \nexperiments are given in Table 6.2.\nIt is evident from the experiments 1, 2, \n3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted = \u00bd (number of moles of HI formed). Also, experiments 5 and 6 indicate that,\n[H\n2(g)]eq = [I2(g)]eq\nKnowing the above facts, in order \nto establish a relationship between concentrations of the reactants and products, several combinations can be tried.

However, if we consider \nthe expression,\n[HI(g)]2\neq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq\nwe find that this expression gives constant value (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six cases. It can be seen that in this expression the power of the concentration for reactants and products are actually the stoichiometric coefficients in the equation for the chemical reaction. Thus, for the reaction H\n2(g) + I2(g)   \n2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium constant K\nc is written as,\nKc  = [HI(g)]eq2 / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq                   (6.2)\nGenerally the subscript \u2018eq\u2019 (used for \nequilibrium) is omitted from the concentration terms. It is taken for granted that the concentrations in the expression for K\nc are \nequilibrium values. We, therefore, write,\nKc  = [HI(g)]2 / [H2(g)] [I2(g)]                 (6.3)\nThe subscript \u2018c \u2019 indicates that Kc is \nexpressed in concentrations of mol L\u20131. \nAt a given temperature, the product of \nconcentrations of the reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation divided by the product of concentrations of the reactants raised to their individual stoichiometric coefficients has a constant value. \nthis is known as \nthe Equilibrium law or law of Chemical \nEquilibrium.The equilibrium constant for a general \nreaction,\na A   +  b B  c C  +  d D\nis expressed as,\nKc  = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                                       (6.4)\nwhere [A], [B], [C] and [D] are the equilibrium \nconcentrations of the reactants and products.\nEquilibrium constant for the reaction,\n4NH3(g) + 5O2(g)  4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) is written \nas \nKc  = [NO]4[H2O]6 / [NH3]4 [O2]5  \nMolar concentration of different species is \nindicated by enclosing these in square bracket \nand, as mentioned above, it is implied that these are equilibrium concentrations. While writing expression for equilibrium constant, symbol for phases (s, l, g) are generally ignored. \nLet us write equilibrium constant for the \nreaction, H\n2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)               (6.5)\nas,  Kc = [HI]2 / [H2] [I2] = x                (6.6)\nThe equilibrium constant for the reverse \nreaction, 2HI(g)  H2(g) + I2(g), at the same \ntemperature is,\nK\u2032\nc = [H2] [I2] / [HI]2 = 1/ x = 1 / Kc                (6.7)\nThus, K\u2032\nc = 1 / Kc                                                    (6.8)\nEquilibrium constant for the reverse \nreaction is the inverse of the equilibrium \nconstant for the reaction in the forward direction.\nIf we change the stoichiometric coefficients \nin a chemical equation by multiplying throughout by a factor then we must make sure that the expression for equilibrium constant also reflects that change. For example, if the  reaction (6.5) is written as,\n\u00bd H\n2(g) + \u00bd I2(g)  HI(g)                   (6.9)\nthe equilibrium constant for the above \nreaction is given by\nK\u2033c   =  [HI] / [H2]1/2[I2]1/2 = {[HI]2 / [H2][I2]}1/2 \n                                = x1/2 = Kc1/2 (6.10)\nOn multiplying the equation (6.5) by n, we getta b l e  6 . 3  Expression involving the  \nEquilibrium Concentration of \nreactants \nH2(g) + i2(g)       2H i(g)\nUnit 6.indd   176 9/12/2022   11:58:22 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "177\nEQUILIBRIUM\nnH2(g) +  nI2(g) D  2nHI(g)                 (6.11)\nTherefore, equilibrium constant for the \nreaction is equal to Kc n.

This results in units of equilibrium constant based on molarity or pressure, unless the exponents of both the numerator and denominator are same.\nFor the reactions,\nH\n2(g) + I2(g)  2HI, Kc and Kp have no \nunit.\nN2O4(g)  2NO2 (g), Kc has unit mol/L \nand Kp has unit bar\nEquilibrium constants can also be \nexpressed as dimensionless quantities if the \nstandard state of reactants and products are specified. For a pure gas, the standard state is 1bar. Therefore a pressure of 4 bar in standard state can be expressed as 4 bar/1 bar = 4, which is a dimensionless number. Standard state (c\n0) for a solute is 1 \nmolar solution and all concentrations can be measured with respect to it. The numerical value of equilibrium constant depends on the standard state chosen. Thus, in this system both K\np and Kc are dimensionless quantities \nbut have different numerical values due to different standard states.

But it is important to note that an equilibrium constant does not give any information about the rate at which the equilibrium is reached. The magnitude of K\nc or Kp is directly proportional to the \nconcentrations of products (as these appear in the numerator of equilibrium constant expression) and inversely proportional to the concentrations of the reactants (these appear in the denominator). This implies that a high value of K is suggestive of a high concentration \nof products and vice-versa.\nWe can make the following generalisations \nconcerning the composition of equilibrium mixtures:\n\u2022\tIf Kc > 103, products predominate over \nreactants, i.e., if Kc is very large, the \nreaction proceeds nearly to completion.

This implies maximum yield of products at mild temperature and pressure conditions. If it does not happen, then the experimental conditions need to be adjusted. For example, in the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia from N\n2 and \nH2, the choice of experimental conditions is \nof real economic importance. Annual world  production of ammonia is about hundred million tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.\nEquilibrium constant, K\nc is independent \nof initial concentrations. But if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in the concentration of one or more of the reacting substances, then the system is no longer at equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in some direction until the system returns to equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change in temperature or pressure of the system may also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide what course the reaction adopts and make a qualitative prediction about the effect of a change in conditions on equilibrium we use Le Chatelier\u2019s principle. It states that a change in any of the factors that determine the equilibrium conditions of a system will cause the system to change in such a manner so as to reduce or to counteract the effect of the change. This is applicable to all physical and chemical equilibria. \nWe shall now be discussing factors which \ncan influence the equilibrium.\n6.8.1\n Effect of Concentration Change\nIn general, w\nhen equilibrium is disturbed \nby the addition/removal of any reactant/\nproducts, Le Chatelier\u2019s principle predicts that:\n\u2022\n The concentration stress of an added  \nreactant/product is relieved by net \nreaction in \nthe direction that consumes \nthe added substance.\n\u2022 The concentration stress of a removed reactant/product is relieved by net reaction \nin the direction that replenishes \nthe removed substance.\n or in other words, \u201cWhen the concentration of any of the \nreactants \nor products in a reaction at \nequilibrium is changed, the composition \nof the equilibrium mixture changes so as to minimize the effect of concentration changes\u201d.\n Let us take the reaction,\nH2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)\nIf H2 is added to the reaction mixture \nat equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the \nreaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein H\n2 is consumed, i.e.,  more of H2 and I2 react \nto form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts in right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in accordance with the Le Chatelier\u2019s principle which implies that in case of addition of a reactant/product, a new equilibrium will be set up in which the concentration of the reactant/product should be less than what it was after the addition but more than what it was in the original mixture.\nThe same point can be explained in terms \nof the reaction quotient, Q\nc,\nQc = [HI]2/ [H2][I2]\nUnit 6.indd   185 11/30/2022   15:48:33\nReprint 2025-26\n", "186\nchemistry\nAddition of hydrogen at equilibrium \nresults in value of Qc being less than Kc . Thus, \nin order to attain equilibrium again reaction \nmoves in the forward direction. Similarly, we can say that removal of a product also boosts the forward reaction and increases the concentration of the products and this has great commercial application in cases of reactions, where the product is a gas or a volatile substance. In case of manufacture of ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed from the reaction mixture so that reaction keeps moving in forward direction. Similarly, in the large scale production of CaO (used as important building material) from CaCO\n3, \nconstant removal of CO2 from the kiln drives \nthe reaction to completion. It should be remembered that continuous removal of a product maintains Q\nc at a value less than Kc \nand reaction continues to move in the forward direction.\nEffect of Concentration \u2013 An experiment\nThis can be demonstrated by the following \nreaction: \nFe\n3+(aq)+ SCN\u2013(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)        (6.24)\nyellow      colourless      deep red\n        (6.25)\nA reddish colour appears on adding two \ndrops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution\n \nto 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due \nto the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+. The intensity \nof the red colour becomes constant on attaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be shifted in either forward or reverse directions depending on our choice of adding a reactant or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted in the opposite direction by adding reagents that remove Fe\n3+ or SCN\u2013 ions. For example, \noxalic acid (H2C2O4), reacts with Fe3+ ions \nto form the stable complex ion [Fe(C2O4)3]3\u2013, \nthus decreasing the concentration of free Fe\n3+(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier\u2019s \nprinciple, the concentration stress of removed Fe\n3+ is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ \nto replenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the \nintensity of red colour decreases.\nAddition of aq. HgCl2 also decreases red \ncolour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN\u2013 ions to \nform stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)4]2\u2013. Removal \nof free SCN\u2013 (aq) shifts the equilibrium \nin equation (6.24) from right to left to \nreplenish SCN\u2013 ions.  Addition of potassium \nthiocyanate on the other hand increases the colour intensity of the solution as it shift the equilibrium to right.\n6.8.2\n Effect of Pressure Change\nA pressure change obtained by changing the \nvolume can affect the yield of products in case of\n a gaseous reaction where the total \nnumber of moles of gaseous reactants and total number of moles of gaseous products are different. In applying Le Chatelier\u2019s principle to a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect of pressure changes on solids and liquids can be ignored because the volume (and concentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly independent of pressure.\nConsider the reaction,\nCO(g) + 3H\n2(g)  CH4(g) + H2O(g)\nHere, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H2) \nbecome 2 mol of gaseous products (CH4 + \nH2O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above \nreaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston \nat constant temperature is compressed to one half of its original volume. Then, total pressure will be doubled (according to  \npV = constant). The partial pressure and therefore, concentration of reactants and products have changed and the mixture is no longer at equilibrium. The direction in which the reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier\u2019s principle. Since pressure has doubled, the equilibrium now shifts in the forward direction, a direction in which the number of moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we know pressure is proportional to moles of the gas). This can also be understood by using reaction quotient, Q\nc. Let [CO], [H2], [CH4] \nand [H2O] be the molar concentrations at \nequilibrium for methanation reaction. When \nvolume of the reaction mixture is halved, the \nUnit 6.indd   186 9/12/2022   11:58:25 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "187\nEQUILIBRIUM\nFig. 6.9  Effect of temperature on equilibrium for \nthe reaction, 2NO2 (g)  N2O4 (g)\npartial pressure and the concentration are \ndoubled.

It is because the addition of \nan inert gas at constant volume does not change the partial pressures or the molar concentrations of the substance involved in the reaction. The reaction quotient changes only if the added gas is a reactant or product involved in the reaction.\n6.8.4\n Effect of Temperature Change\nWhenever an equilibrium is disturbed by \na change in the concentration, pressure or volume, the composition \nof the equilibrium \nmixture changes because the reaction quotient, Q\nc no longer equals the equilibrium \nconstant, Kc. However, when a change in \ntemperature occurs, the value of equilibrium constant, K\nc  is changed.\nIn general, the temperature dependence \nof the equilibrium constant depends on the \nsign of \u2206H for the reaction.\n\u2022\tThe equilibrium constant for an exothermic \nreaction (negative \u2206H) decreases as the \ntemperature increases.\n\u2022\tThe equilibrium constant for an endothermic reaction (positive \u2206H) \nincreases as the temperature increases.\nTemperature changes affect the \nequilibrium constant and rates of reactions. Production of ammonia according to the \nreaction,\nN\n2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g); \n\u2206H= \u2013 92.38 kJ mol\u20131\nis an exothermic process. According to  \nLe Chatelier\u2019s principle, raising the \ntemperature shifts the equilibrium to left and decreases the equilibrium concentration of ammonia. In other words, low temperature is favourable for high yield of ammonia, but practically very low temperatures slow down the reaction and thus a catalyst is used.\nEffect of Temperature \u2013 An experiment\nEffect of temperature on equilibrium can \nbe demonstrated by taking NO\n2 gas (brown \nin colour) which dimerises into N2O4 gas \n(colourless).\n2NO2(g)  N2O4(g); \u2206H = \u201357.2 kJ mol\u20131\nNO2 gas prepared by addition of Cu \nturnings to conc.

Three 250 mL beakers 1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water at room temperature and hot water (363K), respectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test tubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes. After this one is placed in beaker 1 and the other in beaker  3. The effect of temperature on direction of reaction is depicted very well in this experiment. At low temperatures in beaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of N\n2O4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, \nand thus, intensity of brown colour due to NO\n2 decreases. While in beaker 3, high \ntemperature favours the reverse reaction of \nUnit 6.indd   187 11/2/2022   4:11:28 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "188\nchemistry\nformation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour \nintensifies.\nEffect of temperature can also be seen in \nan endothermic reaction,\n[Co(H2O)6]3+(aq) + 4Cl\u2013(aq) [CoCl4 ]2\u2013(aq) +   \n                                                               6H2O(l)\n pink  colourless  blue\nAt room temperature, the equilibrium \nmixture is blue due to [CoCl4]2\u2013. When cooled \nin a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture \nturns pink due to [Co(H2O)6]3+.\n6.8.5  Effect of a Catalyst\nA catalyst increases the rate of the chemical \nreaction by making available a new low energy pathway for \nthe conversion of reactants to \nproducts. It increases the rate of forward and reverse reactions that pass through the same transition state and does not affect equilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation energy for the forward and reverse reactions by exactly the same amount. Catalyst does not affect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture. It does not appear in the balanced chemical equation or in the equilibrium constant expression.\nLet us consider the formation of NH\n3 \nfrom dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is highly exothermic reaction and proceeds with decrease in total number of moles formed as compared to the reactants. Equilibrium constant decreases with increase in temperature. At low temperature rate decreases and it takes long time to reach at equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give \nsatisfactory rates but poor yields. \nGerman chemist, Fritz Haber discovered \nthat a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse \nthe reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate at temperatures, where the equilibrium concentration of NH\n3 is reasonably favourable. \nSince the number of moles formed in the reaction is less than those of reactants, the yield of NH\n3 can be improved by increasing \nthe pressure.\nOptimum conditions of temperature \nand pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using \ncatalyst are around 500\u00b0C and 200 atm.Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric \nacid by contact process,\n2SO2(g) + O2(g)  2SO3(g);  Kc = 1.7 \u00d7 1026\nthough the value of K is suggestive of reaction \ngoing to completion, but practically the \noxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus, \nplatinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2O5) \nis used as catalyst to increase the rate of the reaction.\nNote: If a reaction has an exceedingly small \nK, a catalyst would be of little help.\n6.9\n IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTION\nUnder the effect of change of concentration \non the directi\non of equilibrium, you have \nincidently come across with the following \nequilibrium which involves ions:\nFe3+(aq) + SCN\u2013(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)\nThere are numerous equilibria that involve \nions only. In the following sections we will \nstudy the equilibria involving ions. It is well known that the aqueous solution of sugar does not conduct electricity. However, when common salt (sodium chloride) is added to water it conducts electricity. Also, the conductance of electricity increases with an increase in concentration of common salt. Michael Faraday classified the substances into two categories based on their ability to conduct electricity. One category of substances conduct electricity in their aqueous solutions and are called electrolytes  \nwhile the other do not and are thus, referred to as non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified \nelectrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes. \nStrong electrolytes on dissolution in water are ionized almost completely, while the weak electrolytes are only partially dissociated.  \nFor example, an aqueous solution of  \nsodium chloride is comprised entirely of \nsodium ions and chloride ions, while that  \nof acetic acid mainly contains unionized  \nacetic acid molecules and only some acetate ions and hydronium ions. This is because  \nthere is almost 100% ionization in case of sodium chloride as compared to less  \nthan 5% ionization of acetic acid which is  \na weak electrolyte. It should be noted  \nUnit 6.indd   188 11/2/2022   4:11:28 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "189\nEQUILIBRIUM\nFig.6.10  Dissolution of sodium chloride in water. \nNa+ and Cl\u2013 ions are stablised by their \nhydration with polar water molecules.that in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is \nestablished between ions and the unionized molecules. This type of equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solution is called ionic equilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come under the category of electrolytes and may act as either strong or weak electrolytes.\n6.10\n ACiDS, bASES A nD SAltS\nAcids, bases and salts find widespread \noccurrence i\nn nature. Hydrochloric acid \npresent in the gastric juice is secreted by the lining of our stomach in a significant amount of 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive  processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main constituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange juices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and tartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As most of the acids taste sour, the word \u201cacid\u201d has been derived from a latin word \u201cacidus\u201d meaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue litmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen on reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases are known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste bitter and feel soapy. A common example of a base is washing soda used for washing purposes. When acids and bases are mixed in the right proportion they react with each other to give salts. Some commonly known \nexamples of salts are sodium chloride, barium sulphate, sodium nitrate.  Sodium chloride (common salt) is an important component of our diet and is formed by reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It exists in solid state as a cluster of positively \ncharged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions which are held together due to electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic forces between two charges are inversely proportional to dielectric constant of the medium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses a very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus, when sodium chloride is dissolved in water, the electrostatic interactions are reduced by a factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to move freely in the solution. Also, they are well-separated due to hydration with water molecules. \nFaraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of \n14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent.  During this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the leading scientists of the time.

The extent to which ionization occurs depends upon the strength of the bond and the extent of solvation of ions produced. The terms dissociation and ionization have earlier been used with different meaning. Dissociation refers to the process of separation of ions in water already existing as such in the solid state of the solute, as in sodium chloride. On the other hand, ionization corresponds to a process in which a neutral molecule splits into charged ions in the solution. Here, we shall not distinguish between the two and use the two terms interchangeably. \n6.10.1\n Arrhenius Concept of Acids and \nbases\nAccording to Arrhenius theory, acids are\n \nsubstances that dissociates in water to \ngive hydrogen ions H+(aq) and bases are \nsubstances that produce hydroxyl ions  \nOH\u2013(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can \nbe represented by the following equations:\nHX (aq) \u2192 H+(aq) + X\u2013 (aq)\nor\nHX(aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 H3O+(aq) + X \u2013(aq)\nA bare proton, H+ is very reactive and \ncannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. \nThus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent water molecule to give trigonal pyramidal  \nhydronium ion, H\n3O+ {[H (H2O)]+} (see box). In \nthis chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) \ninterchangeably to mean the same i.e., a hydrated proton. \nSimilarly, a base molecule like MOH \nionizes in aqueous solution according to the equation:\nMOH(aq) \u2192 M\n+(aq) + OH\u2013(aq)\nThe hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated form in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius concept of acid and base, however, suffers from the limitation of being applicable only to aqueous solutions and also, does not account for the basicity of substances like, ammonia which do not possess a hydroxyl group.6.10.2\n the br\u00f6nsted- lowry Acids and \nbases\nThe Danish chemist, Johannes Br\u00f6nsted and \nthe English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave a more \ngeneral definition of acids and bases. \nAccording to Br\u00f6nsted-Lowry theory, acid \nis a substance that is capable of donating a hydrogen ion H\n+ and bases are substances \ncapable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H+. In \nshort, acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors. \nConsider the example of dissolution of NH\n3 \nin H2O represented by the following equation:Hydronium and Hydroxyl ions\nHydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very \nsmall size (~10\u201315 m radius) and intense electric \nfield, binds itself with the water molecule at one of the two available lone pairs on it giving H\n3O+. This species has been detected in many \ncompounds (e.g., H3O+Cl\u2013) in the solid state. In \naqueous solution the hydronium ion is further hydrated to give species like H\n5O2+, H7O3+ and \nH9O4+. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated \nto give several ionic species like H3O2\u2013, H5O3\u2013 \nand H7O4\u2013 etc.\nThe basic solution is formed due to the \npresence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction, \nwater molecule acts as proton donor and ammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor and are thus, called Lowry-Br\u00f6nsted acid and H9O4+\nUnit 6.indd   190 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "191\nEQUILIBRIUM\nArrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden.

In the reverse reaction, \nH+ is transferred from NH4+ to OH\u2013. In this \ncase, NH4+ acts as a Bronsted acid while \nOH\u2013 acted as a Br\u00f6nsted base. The acid-base \npair that differs only by one proton is called a conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH\n\u2013 \nis called the conjugate base of an acid H2O \nand NH4+ is called conjugate acid of the base \nNH3. If Br\u00f6nsted acid is a strong acid then \nits conjugate base is a weak base and vice-\nversa. It may be noted that conjugate acid \nhas one extra proton and each conjugate base has one less proton.\nConsider the example of ionization of \nhydrochloric acid in water.

Similarly, H2O is \na conjugate base of an acid H3O+ and H3O+ is \na conjugate acid of base H2O.\nIt is interesting to observe the dual role \nof water as an acid and a base.

Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as \na \nspecies which accepts electron pair and base \nwhich donates an electron pair. As far as bases are concerned, there is not much difference between Br\u00f6nsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts, as the base provides a lone pair in both the cases. However, in Lewis concept many acids do not have proton. A typical example is reaction of electron deficient species BF\n3 \nwith NH3.\nBF3 does not have a proton but still acts \nas an acid and reacts with NH3 by accepting \nits lone pair of electrons.

Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO\n4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic \nacid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO\n3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed \nstrong because they are almost completely dissociated into their constituent ions in an aqueous medium, thereby acting as proton (H\n+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like \nlithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium hydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide Ba(OH)\n2 are almost completely dissociated \ninto ions in an aqueous medium giving hydroxyl ions, OH\n\u2013. According to Arrhenius \nconcept they are strong acids and bases as they are able to completely dissociate and produce H\n3O+\n and OH\u2013 ions respectively in \nthe medium. Alternatively, the strength of an acid or base may also be gauged in terms of Br\u00f6nsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases, wherein a strong acid means a good proton donor and a strong base implies a good proton acceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation equilibrium of a weak acid HA,\nHA(aq)  +  H\n2O(l) \uf020\uf020  H3O+(aq)  +  A\u2013(aq)\n                                     conjugate    conjugate\nacid         base              acid            base\nIn section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or \nbase) \ndissociation equilibrium is dynamic \ninvolving a transfer of proton in forward and \nreverse directions. Now, the question arises that if the equilibrium is dynamic then with passage of time which direction is favoured? What is the driving force behind it? In order to answer these questions we shall deal into the issue of comparing the strengths of the two acids (or bases) involved in the dissociation equilibrium. Consider the two acids HA and H\n3O+ present in the above \nmentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium. We have to see which amongst them is a stronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds in its tendency of donating a proton over the other shall be termed as the stronger acid and the equilibrium will shift in the direction of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid than H\n3O+, then HA will donate protons and \nnot H3O+, and the solution will mainly contain \nA\u2013 and H3O+ ions. The equilibrium moves in \nthe direction of formation of weaker acid \nUnit 6.indd   192 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "193\nEQUILIBRIUM\nand weaker base because the stronger acid \ndonates a proton to the stronger base . \nIt follows that \nas a strong acid dissociates \ncompletely in water, the resulting base formed would be very weak i.e., strong acids have \nvery weak conjugate bases. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO\n4), hydrochloric acid \n(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO\n3) and sulphuric acid \n(H2SO4) will give conjugate base ions ClO4\u2013, Cl, \nBr\u2013, I\u2013, NO3\u2013 and HSO4\u2013 , which are much weaker \nbases than H2O. Similarly a very strong base \nwould give a very weak conjugate acid. On the other hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially dissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the solution mainly contains undissociated HA molecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous acid (HNO\n2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic \nacid (CH3COOH). It should be noted that the \nweak acids have very strong conjugate bases. For example, NH\n2\u2013, O2\u2013 and H\u2013 are very good \nproton acceptors and thus, much stronger bases than H\n2O. \nCertain water soluble organic compounds \nlike phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue behave as weak acids and exhibit different colours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base (In\n\u2013 ) forms.\nHIn(aq)  +   H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)   +   In\u2013(aq)  \nacid    conjugate  conjugate\nindicator         acid           base\ncolour A        \n        colour B\nSuch compounds are useful as indicators \nin acid-base titrations, and finding out H+ ion \nconcentration.\n6.11.1  the ionization Constant of Water \nand its ionic Product\nSome substances like water are unique in\n \ntheir ability of acting both as an acid and a \nbase. We have seen this in case of water in section 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it accepts a proton and acts as the base while in the presence of a base, B\n\u2013 it acts as an \nacid by donating a proton. In pure water, one H\n2O molecule donates proton and acts as an \nacid and another water molecules accepts a proton and acts as a base at the same time.   \nThe following equilibrium exists:H\n2O(l)  +  H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)  +   OH\u2013(aq)\nacid        base         conjugate       conjugate\n                          acid                base\nThe dissociation constant is represented by,\nK = [H3O+] [OH\u2013] / [H2O]                    (6.26)\nThe concentration of water is omitted from \nthe denominator as water is a pure liquid and \nits concentration remains constant. [H2O] is \nincorporated within the equilibrium constant  \nto give a new constant, Kw, which is called the \nionic product of water. \n Kw = [H+][OH\u2013]            (6.27)\nThe concentration of H+ has been found \nout experimentally as 1.0 \u00d7 10\u20137 M at 298 K. \nAnd, as dissociation of water produces equal number of H\n+ and OH\u2013 ions, the concentration \nof hydroxyl ions, [OH\u2013] = [H+] = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u20137 M.  \nThus, the value of Kw at 298K,\nKw = [H3O+][OH\u2013] = (1 \u00d7 10\u20137)2 = 1 \u00d7 10\u201314 M2 \n(6.28)\nThe value of Kw is temperature dependent \nas it is an equilibrium constant.\nThe density of pure water is 1000 g / L \nand its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this the molarity of pure water can be given as,\n[H\n2O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M. \nTherefore, the ratio of dissociated water to \nthat of undissociated water can be given as:\n10\u20137 / (55.55) = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u20139 or  ~ 2 in 10\u20139 (thus, \nequilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated \nwater)\nWe can distinguish acidic, neutral and \nbasic aqueous solutions by the relative values \nof the H3O+ and OH\u2013 concentrations:\nAcidic: [H3O+] > [OH\u2013 ]\nNeutral: [H3O+] = [OH\u2013 ]\nBasic : [H3O+] < [OH\u2013]\n6.11.2  the pH Scale\nHydronium ion concentration in \nmolarity is \nmore conveniently expressed on a logarithmic \nscale known as the pH scale. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm \nto base 10 of the activity \naH/unif02b/unif028/unif029  of hydrogen \nUnit 6.indd   193 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "194\nchemistry\nion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity \nof hydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude \nto molarity represented by [H+]. It should  \nbe noted that activity has no units and is \ndefined as:\n  = [H+] / mol L\u20131\nFrom the definition of pH, the following \ncan be written,\npH = \u2013 log aH+ = \u2013 log {[H+] / mol L\u20131}\nThus, an acidic solution of HCl (10\u20132 M) \nwill have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution \nof NaOH having [OH\u2013] =10\u20134 M and [H3O+] =  \n10\u201310 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 \u00b0C, pure \nwater has a concentration of hydrogen ions,  \n[H+] = 10\u20137 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is \ngiven as:\npH = \u2013log(10\u20137) = 7\nAcidic solutions possess a concentration \nof hydrogen ions, [H+] > 10\u20137 M, while basic \nsolutions possess a concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\n+] < 10\u20137 M. thus, we can summarise \nthatAcidic solution has pH < 7\nBasic solution has pH > 7Neutral solution has pH = 7\nNow again, consider the equation (6.28) \nat 298 K\nK\nw = [H3O+] [OH\u2013] = 10\u201314\nTaking negative logarithm on both sides \nof equation, we obtain\n\u2013log Kw = \u2013 log {[H3O+] [OH\u2013]} \n             = \u2013 log [H3O+] \u2013 log [OH\u2013] \n            = \u2013 log 10\u201314\n   pKw  =   pH  +  pOH   =   14             (6.29)\nNote that although Kw may change \nwith temperature the variations in pH with \ntemperature are so small that we often  \nignore it.\npKw is a very important quantity for \naqueous solutions and controls the relative \nconcentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions as their product is a constant. It should be noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, a change in pH by just one unit also means change in [H\n+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] \nchanges by a factor of 100, the value of pH changes by 2 units. Now you can realise why the change in pH with temperature is often ignored.\nMeasurement of pH of a solution is very \nessential as its value should be known when dealing with biological and cosmetic applications. The pH of a solution can be found roughly with the help of pH paper that has different colour in solutions of different pH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with four strips on it. The different strips have different colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH. The pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined with an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper. \nFig.6.11  pH-paper with four strips that may have \ndifferent colours at the same pH\nFor greater accuracy pH meters are used. \npH meter is a device that measures the  \npH-dependent electrical potential of the test \nsolution within 0.001 precision. pH meters of the size of a writing pen are now available in the market.

The \nequilibrium constant for base ionization is called base ionization constant and is represented by K\nb. It can be expressed in \nterms of concentration in molarity of various species in equilibrium by the following equation:\nK\nb = [M+][OH\u2013] / [MOH]          (6.33)\nAlternatively, if c = initial \nconcentration \nof base and \u03b1 = degree of ionization of base \ni.e. the extent to which the base ionizes. When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium constant can be written as:\nK\nb = (c\u03b1)2 / c (1- \u03b1) = c \u03b12 / (1-\u03b1)\nThe values of the ionization constants of \nsome selected weak bases, Kb are given in  \nTable 6.7.\nMany organic compounds like amines  \nare weak bases. Amines are derivatives of \nammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by another group.

Thus,\nKa \u00d7 Kb = {[H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+ ]} \u00d7 {[NH4+]\n                                         [OH\u2013] / [NH3]}\n= [H3O+][OH\u2013] = Kw\n= (5.6 \u00d710\u201310) \u00d7 (1.8 \u00d7 10\u20135) = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u201314 M\nUnit 6.indd   198 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "199\nEQUILIBRIUM\nThis can be extended to make a \ngeneralisation. the equil\nibrium constant \nfor a net reaction obtained after adding \ntwo (or more) reactions equals the product of the equilibrium constants for individual reactions:\nK\nNET = K1 \u00d7 K2 \u00d7 \u2026\u2026                                   (6.35)\nSimilarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base \npair,\nKa \u00d7 Kb = Kw                                                             (6.36)\nKnowing one, the other can be obtained. \nIt should be noted that a strong acid will have a weak conjugate base and vice-versa.\nAlternatively, the above expression  \nK\nw = Ka \u00d7 Kb, can also be obtained by \nconsidering the base-dissociation equilibrium reaction:\nB(aq) + H\n2O(l)         BH+(aq) + OH\u2013(aq)\nKb = [BH+][OH\u2013] / [B] \nAs the concentration of water remains \nconstant it has been omitted from the denominator and incorporated within the dissociation constant.

The ionization constant of ammonia can be taken from Table 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization constant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.\nSolution \nThe ionization of NH\n3 in water is represented \nby equation:NH3  +  H2O           NH4+    +    OH\u2013\nWe use equation (6.33) to calculate \nhydroxyl ion concentration,\n[OH\u2013] = c \u03b1 = 0.05 \u03b1 \nKb = 0.05 \u03b12 / (1 \u2013  \u03b1)\nThe value of \u03b1  is small, therefore the \nquadratic equation can be simplified by \nneglecting \u03b1 in comparison to 1 in the \ndenominator on right hand side of the equation,\nThus,K\nb = c \u03b12  or   \u03b1 = \u221a (1.77 \u00d7 10\u20135 / 0.05)\n                 = 0.018.\n[OH\u2013] = c \u03b1 = 0.05 \u00d7 0.018 = 9.4 \u00d7 10\u20134M.\n[H+] = Kw / [OH\u2013] = 10\u201314 / (9.4 \u00d7 10\u20134) \n                          = 1.06 \u00d7 10\u201311\npH = \u2013log(1.06 \u00d7 10\u201311) = 10.97.\nNow, using the relation for conjugate \nacid-base pair,\nKa \u00d7 Kb = Kw\nusing the value of Kb of NH3 from  \nTable 6.7.We can determine the concentration of \nconjugate acid NH\n4+\nKa = Kw / Kb = 10\u201314 / 1.77 \u00d7 10\u20135 \n                    = 5.64 \u00d7 10\u201310.\n6.11.6  Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di- \nand Polyacidic bases\nSome of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acids have more than one ionizable proton\n per molecule of the \nacid. Such acids are known as polybasic or polyprotic acids.\nThe ionization reactions for example for \na dibasic acid H\n2X are represented by the \nequations:\nH2X(aq)  H+(aq) + HX\u2013(aq)\nHX\u2013(aq)  H+(aq) + X2\u2013(aq)\nAnd the corresponding equilibrium \nconstants are given below:\nKa1= {[H+][HX\u2013]} / [H2X] and\nUnit 6.indd   199 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "200\nchemistry\nKa2 = {[H+][X2-]} / [HX-]\nHere, Ka1and Ka2are called the first and second \nionization constants respectively of the acid H2 \nX. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H3PO4 we \nhave three ionization constants. The values \nof the ionization constants for some common polyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.In general, when strength of H-A bond \ndecreases, that is, the energy required to break the bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger acid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more polar i.e., the electronegativity difference between the atoms H and A increases and there is marked charge separation, cleavage of the bond becomes easier thereby increasing the acidity.\nBut it should be noted that while comparing \nelements in the same group of the periodic table, H-A bond strength is a more important factor in determining acidity than its polar nature. As the size of A increases down the group, H-A bond strength decreases and so the acid strength increases. For example,\nSize increases\nHF << HCl << HBr << HI\nAcid strength increases\nSimilarly, H\n2S is stronger acid than H2O.\nBut, when we discuss elements in the same \nrow of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity becomes the deciding factor for determining the acid strength. As the electronegativity of A increases, the strength of the acid also increases. For example,\nElectronegativity of A increases\nCH\n4 < NH3 < H2O < HF\nAcid strength increases\n6.11.8  Common ion Effect in the \nionization of Acids and bases\nConsider an example of acetic acid dissociation equilibrium represented as:\nCH\n3COOH(aq)   H+(aq) +  CH3COO\u2013 (aq) \nor  HAc(aq)   H+ (aq) + Ac\u2013 (aq)\nKa = [H+][Ac\u2013 ] / [HAc]\nAddition of acetate ions to an acetic \nacid solution results in decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\n+]. Also, \nif H+ ions are added from an external source \nthen the equilibrium moves in the direction of undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction of reducing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\n+]. This phenomenon is an example table 6.8  the ionization Constants of Some \nCommon Polyprotic Acids (298K)\nIt can be seen that higher order ionization \nconstants (Ka2, Ka3) are smaller than the \nlower order ionization constant (Ka1) of a \npolyprotic acid. The reason for this is that \nit is more difficult to remove a positively charged proton from a negative ion due to electrostatic forces. This can be seen in the case of removing a proton from the uncharged H\n2CO3 as compared from a negatively charged \nHCO3\u2013. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove \na proton from a doubly charged HPO42\u2013 anion \nas compared to H2PO4\u2013. \nPolyprotic acid solutions contain a \nmixture of acids like H2A, HA\u2013 and A2\u2013 in case \nof a diprotic acid. H2A being a strong acid, the \nprimary reaction involves the dissociation of H\n2 A, and H3O+ in the solution comes mainly \nfrom the first dissociation step.\n6.11.7  Factors Affecting Acid Strength\nHaving discussed quantitatively the strengths \nof acids and bases, \nwe come to a stage where \nwe can calculate the pH of a given acid solution. But, the curiosity rises about why should some acids be stronger than others? What factors are responsible for making them stronger? The answer lies in its being a complex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking we can say that the extent of dissociation of an acid depends on the strength and polarity  \nof the H-A bond.\nUnit 6.indd   200 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "201\nEQUILIBRIUM\nof common ion effect.

The later process of interaction between water and cations/anions or both of salts is called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution gets affected by this interaction. The cations (e.g., Na\n+, K+, Ca2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases \nand anions (e.g., Cl\u2013, Br\u2013, NO3\u2013, ClO4\u2013 etc.) of \nstrong acids simply get hydrated but do not hydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of salts formed from strong acids and bases are neutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other category of salts do undergo hydrolysis.\nWe now consider the hydrolysis of the \nsalts of the following types :\n(i)\n salts of weak acid and strong base e.g., \nCH3COONa.\n(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g., NH\n4Cl, and\n(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g., CH\n3COONH4.\nIn the first case, CH3COONa being a salt of \nweak acid, CH3COOH and strong base, NaOH \ngets completely ionised in aqueous solution.\nCH3COONa(aq)   \u2192  CH3COO\u2013 (aq)+  Na+(aq)\nAcetate ion thus formed undergoes \nhydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and \nOH\u2013 ions\nCH3COO\u2013(aq)+H2O(l) CH3COOH(aq)+OH\u2013(aq)\nAcetic acid being a weak acid  \n(Ka = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u20135) remains mainly unionised in \nsolution. This results in increase of OH\u2013 ion \nconcentration in solution making it alkaline. The pH of such a solution is more than 7.\nSimilarly, NH\n4Cl formed from weak \nbase, NH4OH and strong acid, HCl, in water \ndissociates completely.\nNH4Cl(aq) \u2192 NH+\n4(aq)  +Cl\u2013 (aq)\nAmmonium ions undergo hydrolysis with \nwater to form NH4OH and H+ ions\nNH+\n4 (aq) + H2O (1)  NH4OH(aq) + H+(aq) \nAmmonium hydroxide is a weak base  \n(Kb = 1.77 \u00d7 10\u20135) and therefore remains \nalmost unionised in solution. This results in increased of H+ ion concentration in solution \nmaking the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of \nNH4Cl solution in water is less than 7.\nConsider the hydrolysis of CH3COONH4 \nsalt formed from weak acid and weak base. The ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:\nCH\n3COO\u2013 + NH4+ +  H2O   CH3COOH +          \n           \n                                                    NH4OH\nCH3COOH and NH4OH, also remain into \npartially dissociated form:\nCH3COOH         CH3COO\u2013  +  H+\nNH4OH           NH4+    +   OH\u2013\nH2O          H+  +  OH\u2013\nWithout going into detailed calculation, \nit can be said that degree of hydrolysis is \nindependent of concentration of solution, and \npH of such solutions is determined by their pK values: \n pH = 7 + \u00bd (pKa \u2013 pKb)                             (6.38)\nThe pH of solution can be greater than 7, \nif the difference is positive and it will be less than 7, if the difference is negative.\nProblem 6.25\nThe pK\na of acetic acid and pKb of ammonium \nhydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively. \nCalculate the pH of ammonium acetate solution.\nSolution\npH = 7 + \u00bd [p K\na \u2013 pKb]\n       = 7 + \u00bd [4.76 \u2013 4.75]\n       = 7 + \u00bd [0.01]  = 7 + 0.005  = 7.005\n6.12 bUFFE r SOlUtiOnS\nMany body fluids \ne.g., blood or urine have \ndefinite pH and any deviation in their pH \nindicates malfunctioning of the body. The control of pH is also very important in many chemical and biochemical processes.

A mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate acts as buffer solution around pH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer around pH 9.25. You will learn more about \nbuffer solutions in higher classes.\n6.12.1\n Designing buffer Solution \nKnowledge of pKa, pKb and equilibrium \nconstant help us to prepare the buffer solution \nof known pH. Let us see how we can do this.\nPreparation of Acidic buffer \nTo prepare a buffer of  acidic pH we \nuse weak \nacid and its salt formed with strong base. \nWe develop the equation relating the pH, the equilibrium constant, K\na  of weak acid and \nratio of concentration of weak acid and its conjugate base. For \nthe general case where \nthe weak acid HA ionises in water, \nHA + H2O \uf0c7 H3O+ + A\u2013\nFor which we can write the expression\nRearranging the expression we have,\nTaking logarithm on both the sides and \nrearranging the terms we get \u2014\n              Or\n                    (6.39)\n    \n(6.40) \nThe expression (6.40) is known \nas \nHenderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation. The \nquantity  is the ratio of concentration \nof conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a \nweak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and concentration of [HA] is negligibly different from concentration of acid taken to form buffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A\n\u2014], \ncomes from the ionisation of salt of the acid. Therefore, the concentration of conjugate base will be negligibly different from the concentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40) takes the form:\n \npp Ka H=[Salt]\n[Acid]+log\nIn the equation (6.39), if the concentration \nof [A\u2014] is equal to the concentration of [HA], \nthen pH = pKa because value of log 1 is zero. \nThus if we take molar concentration of acid \nand salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the buffer solution will be equal to the pK\na of the \nacid. So for preparing the buffer solution of the required pH we select that acid whose pK\na \nis close to the required pH. For acetic acid pK\na value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer \nsolution formed by acetic acid and sodium acetate taken in equal molar concentration will be around 4.76.\nA similar analysis of a buffer made with \na weak base and its conjugate acid leads to \nthe result,\n      \npOH= p+ log[Conju gate acid ,BH+]\n  [Base, B]bK   \n(6.41) \npH of the buffer solution can be calculated\n \nby using the equation pH + pOH =14.\nWe know that pH + pOH = pKw  and  \npKa + pKb = pKw. On putting these values in \nequation (6.41) it takes the form as follows: \np-  pH=pp[Conjuga teacid ,BH]\n  [Base,B]wwKK Ka /unif02d/unif02b/unif02b\nlog\n                           or       \npH=p[Conjuga teacid ,BH]\n  [Base,B]Ka++\nlog\n    (6.42)\nIf molar concentration of base and its \nconjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of \nthe buffer solution will be same as pKa for the \nbase. pKa value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore \na buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained by taking ammonia solution and ammonium \nUnit 6.indd   203 9/12/2022   11:58:29 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "204\nchemistry\nchloride solution of same molar concentration. \nFor a buffer solution formed by ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide, equation  \n(6.42) becomes:\n  pH=[Conju gateacid ,BH]\n  [Base,B]925.l og++\n                 \npH of the buffer solution is not affected by \ndilution because ratio under the logarithmic \nterm remains unchanged. \n6.13 SOlUbilit Y EqUilibri A OF \nSPArinGlY SOlUblE SAltS\nWe have already known that the solubility of \nionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of\n \nthese (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb water vapour from atmosphere. Others (such as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility that they are commonly termed as insoluble. The solubility depends on a number of factors important amongst which are the lattice enthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy of the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve in a solvent the strong forces of attraction between its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be overcome by the ion-solvent interactions. The solvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in terms of solvation which is always negative i.e. energy is released in the process of solvation. The amount of solvation enthalpy depends on the nature of the solvent. In case of a non-polar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is small and hence, not sufficient to overcome lattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the salt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As a general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve in a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy must be greater than its lattice enthalpy so that the latter may be overcome by former. Each salt has its characteristic solubility which depends on temperature. We classify salts on the basis of their solubility in the following three categories.\n Category I     Soluble    Solubility > 0.1M\n Category II    Slightly    0.01M<Solubility< 0.1M\n                      Soluble \n Category III   Sparingly  Solubility < 0.01M                      \nSolubleWe shall now consider the equilibrium \nbetween the sparingly soluble ionic salt and \nits saturated aqueous solution.\n6.13.1  Solubility Product Constant\nLet us now have a solid like barium sulphate \nin contact with its \nsaturated aqueous solution. \nThe equilibrium between the undisolved solid and the ions in a saturated solution can be  represented by the equation:\nBaSO\n4(s) \uf020   Ba2+(aq) + SO42\u2013(aq),\nThe equilibrium constant is given by the \nequation:\nK = {[Ba2+][SO42\u2013]} / [BaSO4]\nFor a pure solid substance the \nconcentration remains constant and we can \nwrite\nKsp = K[BaSO4] = [Ba2+][SO42\u2013]           (6.43)\nWe call Ksp the solubility product constant \nor simply solubility product. The experimental value of K\nsp in above equation at 298K is  \n1.1 \u00d7 10\u201310. This means that for solid barium \nsulphate in equilibrium with its saturated solution, the product of the concentrations of barium and sulphate ions is equal to its solubility product constant. The concentrations of the two ions will be equal to the molar solubility of the barium sulphate. If molar solubility is S, then \n1.1 \u00d7 10\n\u201310 = (S)(S) = S2 \nor                       S = 1.05 \u00d7 10\u20135.\nThus, molar solubility of barium sulphate \nwill be equal to 1.05 \u00d7 10\u20135 mol L\u20131.\nA salt may give on dissociation two or \nmore than two anions and cations carrying \ndifferent charges. For example, consider a salt like zirconium phosphate of molecular formula \n(Zr\n4+)3(PO43\u2013)4. It dissociates into 3 zirconium \ncations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate anions of charge \u20133. If the molar solubility of zirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen from the stoichiometry of the compound that\n[Zr\n4+] = 3S and [PO43\u2013] = 4S \nand Ksp = (3S)3 (4S)4 = 6912 (S)7\nor S = {Ksp / (33 \u00d7 44)}1/7 = (Ksp / 6912)1/7\nUnit 6.indd   204 9/12/2022   11:58:30 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "205\nEQUILIBRIUM\nA solid salt of the general formula MXxp\nyq /unif02b/unif02d\nwith molar solubility S in equilibrium with \nits saturated solution may be represented by the equation:\nM\nxXy(s)          xMp+(aq) + yXq\u2013 (aq)\n(where x \u00d7 p+ = y \u00d7 q\u2013)\nAnd its solubility product constant is \ngiven by:\nKsp   = [Mp+]x[Xq\u2013 ]y = (xS)x(yS)y      (6.44) \n       = xx . yy .

Similarly, if the concentration of one of \nthe ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve to increase the concentration of both the ions till once again K\nsp = Qsp. This is applicable \neven to soluble salts like sodium chloride except that due to higher concentrations of the ions, we use their activities instead of their molarities in the expression for Q\nsp. Thus if we take a saturated solution of \nsodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it, then sodium chloride is precipitated due to increased concentration (activity) of chloride ion available from the dissociation of HCl. Sodium chloride thus obtained is of very high purity and we can get rid of impurities like sodium and magnesium sulphates. The common ion effect is also used for almost complete precipitation of a particular ion as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low value of solubility product for gravimetric estimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion as silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide (or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as its sulphate for quantitative estimations.Dissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH)\n2 provides \nS mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH\u2013, but \nthe total concentration of OH\u2013 = (0.10 + 2S) \nmol/L because the solution already contains \n0.10 mol/L of OH\u2013 from NaOH.\nKsp = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u201315 = [Ni2+] [OH\u2013]2 \n                         = (S) (0.10 + 2S)2\nAs Ksp is small, 2S << 0.10, \nthus, (0.10 + 2S) \u2248 0.10\nHence,2.0 \u00d7 10\n\u201315 = S (0.10)2\nS = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u201313 M = [Ni2+]\nProblem 6.28\nCalculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH)2 in \n0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of Ni(OH)2 \nis 2.0 \u00d7 10\u201315.\nSolutionLet the solubility of Ni(OH)\n2 be equal to S. The solubility of salts of weak acids like \nphosphates increases at lower pH. This is \nbecause at lower pH the concentration of the anion decreases due to its protonation. This in turn increase the solubility of the salt so that K\nsp = Qsp. We have to satisfy two equilibria \nsimultaneously i.e.,\nKsp = [M+] [X\u2013],\n                          \n [X\u2013] / [HX] = Ka/[H+] \nTaking inverse of both side and adding 1 \nwe get\nHX\nXH\nHX H\nXHa\na\na/unif05b/unif05d\n/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif02b/unif03d/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif02b\n/unif05b/unif05d /unif02b/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb\n/unif0e9\n/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif03d/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif02b/unif02d/unif02b\n/unif02d\n/unif02d/unif02b11K\nK\nK\nNow, again taking inverse, we get\n[X\u2013] / {[X\u2013] + [HX]} = f = Ka/(Ka + [H+]) and it \ncan be seen that \u2018f\u2019 decreases as pH decreases. \nIf S is the solubility of the salt at a given  \npH then \nKsp = [S] [f S] = S2 {Ka/(Ka + [H+])} and\nS = {Ksp ([H+] + Ka)/Ka}1/2    (6.46)\nThus solubility S increases with increase \nin [H+] or decrease in pH. \nUnit 6.indd   206 9/12/2022   11:58:30 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "207\nEQUILIBRIUM\nSUmmArY\nWhen the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules \nreturning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in nature.

It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.\nAll substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, \nbases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes \nin aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. \nbr\u00f6nsted- lowry on \nthe other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as \na proton acceptor. When a Br\u00f6nsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. \nlewis further \ngeneralised the definition of an \nacid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (K\na) and weak bases (Kb) are developed \nusing Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = \u2013log[H\n+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration \n(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = \u2013 log[OH\u2013]); pKa = \u2013log[Ka];  \npKb = \u2013log[Kb]; and pKw = \u2013log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we \nnote that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and \nweak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed \nbriefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium constant is introduced as solubility product constant  (K\nsp). Its relationship with solubility \nof the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.\nUnit 6.indd   207 9/12/2022   11:58:31 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "208\nchemistry\nSUGGES tED AC tiVitiES FO r StUDEntS rEGArDinG tHiS Unit\n(a) The student may use pH paper in determini ng the pH of fresh juices of various vegetables \nand fruits, soft drinks, body fluids and also that of water samples available.\n(b) The pH paper may also be used to determine the pH of different salt solutions and from \nthat he/she may determine if these are formed from strong/weak acids and bases.\n(c) They may prepare some buffer \nsolutions by mixing the solutions of sodium acetate and \nacetic acid and determine their pH using pH paper.\n(d) They may be provided with different \nindicators to observe their colours in solutions of \nvarying pH.\n(e) They may perform some acid-base titrations using indicators.\n(f) They may observe common ion effect on the solubility of sparingly soluble salts.    \n(g) If pH meter is available in their school, they may measure the pH with it and compare the results obtained with that of the pH paper.\nEXErCiSES\n6.1 A liquid is in equilibrium with its vapour in a sealed container at a fixed temperature.The volume of the container is suddenly increased.\na)\n What is the initial effect of the change on vapour pressure?\nb) How do rates of evaporation and condensation change initially?\nc) What happens when equilibrium \nis restored finally and what will be the final vapour \npressure? \n6.2 What is Kc for the following equilibrium when the equilibrium concentration of each \nsubstance is: [SO2]= 0.60M, [O2] = 0.82M and [SO3] = 1.90M ?\n2SO2(g) + O2(g)    2SO3(g)\n6.3 At a certain temperature \nand total pressure of 105Pa, iodine vapour contains 40% by \nvolume of I atoms\nI2 (g)    2I (g)\n Calculate Kp for the equilibrium.\n6.4 Write the expression for the equilibrium constant, Kc for each of the following reactions:\n (i) 2NOCl (g)    2NO (g) + Cl2 (g)\n (ii) 2Cu(NO3)2 (s)    2CuO (s) + 4NO2 (g) + O2 (g)\n (iii) CH3COOC2H5(aq) + H2O(l)    CH3COOH (aq) + C2H5OH (aq)\n (iv) Fe3+ (aq) + 3OH\u2013 (aq)    Fe(OH)3 (s)\n (v) I2 (s) + 5F2    2IF5\n6.5 Find out the value of Kc for each of the following equilibria from the value of Kp:\n (i)  2NOCl (g)    2NO (g) + Cl2 (g);  Kp= 1.8 \u00d7 10\u20132 at 500 K\n (ii) CaCO3 (s)    CaO(s) + CO2(g);  Kp= 167 at 1073 K\nUnit 6.indd   208 9/12/2022   11:58:31 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "209\nEQUILIBRIUM\n6.6 For the following equilibrium, Kc= 6.3 \u00d7 1014 at 1000 K \n NO (g) + O3 (g)     NO2 (g) + O2 (g)\n  Both the forward and reverse reactions in the equilibrium are elementary bimolecular  \n reactions.
