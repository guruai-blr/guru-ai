W e have alr eady lear nt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.\nYou may per haps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese questions.\nFigure 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glassActivity 1.1Activity 1.1Activity 1.1Activity 1.1Activity 1.1\nCAUTION:  This Activity needs\nthe teacher\u2019s assistance.

This description of a\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation.\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be \u2013\nMagnesium + Oxygen \u2192Magnesium oxide (1.1)\n            (Reactants) (Product)\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction.You must have observed that magnesium ribbon bur ns with a\ndazzling white flame and changes into a white powder . This powder is\nmagnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium\nand oxygen present in the air .\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Chemical Reactions and Equations 31.1.1 W riting a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as \u2013\nMg + O2  \u2192  MgO (1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the bur ning of magnesium in air .\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as \u2013\nZinc + Sulphuric acid  \u2192  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation \u2013\nZn + H2SO4 \u2192 ZnSO4 + H2(1.3)\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\nElement Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nZn 1 1\nH 2 2\nS 1 1\nO 4 4\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation \u2013\nFe + H2O \u2192 Fe3O4 + H2(1.4)\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Science 4Step I:  To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation.\nFe   +   H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   H2(1.5)\nStep II:  List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5).\nElement Number of atoms Number of atoms\nin reactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nFe 1 3\nH 2 2\nO 1 4\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n\u20184\u2019 as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecome s\u2013\nFe   +   4 H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   H2\nStep IV:  Fe and H atoms ar e still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further . Let us balance hydr ogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.\nTo balance the oxygen atoms \u2013\nThe equation would be \u2013\n  Fe   +   4   H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   4 H2Atoms of In reactants In products\noxygen\n(i)Initial 1 (in H2O) 4 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)To balance 1\u00d74 4\nAtoms of In reactants In products\nhydrogen\n(i)Initial 8 (in 4 H2O) 2 (in H2)\n(ii)To balance 8 2 \u00d7 4(1.6)\n(partly balanced equation)\n(1.7)\n(partly balanced equation)\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Chemical Reactions and Equations 5To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.\n3   Fe   +   4   H2O   \u2192   Fe3O4   +   4   H2(1.8)\nStep VI:  Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n3Fe + 4H2O \u2192 Fe3O4 + 4H2\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical StatesWriting Symbols of Physical States   Car efully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water .\nThe balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)  \u2192 Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) (1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example \u2013\nCO(g) + 2H (g)2340at\nmCH OH(l)3 \uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 (1.11)\n6CO (aq) 12H O(l) C H O (aq) 6O2 2 6 12 6 + +Sunlight\nChlor\nophyll\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e72 2 2 (aq ) 6H O(l)+ (1.12)\n   (Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq.

W e get this ener gy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.\nThis glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy.

Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin\nlayer of calcium carbonate on the walls.

Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO2 and SO3 are gases.\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries.

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner . Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to r eplace damaged ir on. You will lear n mor e about corr osion in\nChapter 3.\n1.3.2 Rancidity\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left\nfor a long time?\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell\nand taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that\nchips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as\nnitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1 ,     where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen)\nand changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide.

Equations must always be balanced.\n/square6In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single\nsubstance.\n/square6Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition\nreaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances.\n/square6Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic\nreactions.\n/square6Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.\n/square6When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement\nreaction occurs.\n/square6Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement\nreactions.\n/square6Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.\n/square6Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.\nOxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen\nor gain of hydrogen.\nEXERCISES\n1.Which of the statements about the reaction below are incorrect?\n2PbO(s) + C(s) \u2192  2Pb(s) + CO2(g)\n(a) Lead is getting reduced.\n(b) Carbon dioxide is getting oxidised.\n(c) Carbon is getting oxidised.\n(d) Lead oxide is getting reduced.\n(i)(a) and (b)\n(ii) (a) and (c)\n(iii) (a), (b) and (c)\n(iv) all\n2.Fe2O3 + 2Al \u2192 Al2O3 + 2Fe\nThe above reaction is an example of a\n(a) combination reaction.\n(b) double displacement reaction.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Chemical Reactions and Equations 15(c) decomposition reaction.\n(d) displacement reaction.\n3.What happens when dilute hydr ochloric acid is added to iron fillings?
