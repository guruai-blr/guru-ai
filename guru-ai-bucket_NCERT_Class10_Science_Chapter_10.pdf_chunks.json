Y ou also studied the natur e, position and r elative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter .\nWe have lear nt in the pr evious chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter , we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in natur e. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however , impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe h\numan eye is like a camera.  Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at dif ferent distances on the r etina. W e find a structur e called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\nFigure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1\nThe human eye\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Science 162entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvatur e of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker .\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation.  However , the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit.  T ry to r ead a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. Y ou may see the image being blurr ed\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a nor mal eye. Y ou may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hyper metr opia or far -\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. W e discuss below these defects\nand their correction.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 163(a)Myopia\nMyopia is also known as near -\nsightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power . This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)Hypermetropia\nHyper metropia is also known as far -sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appropriate power . This is illustrated in\nFig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n(c)   Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses.  This defect is\ncalled Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradualFigure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2\n(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a\nconcave lens\nFigure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropia\nN = Near point of a\n      hypermetropic eye.\nN\u2019 = Near point of a\n      normal eye.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Science 164Think it over\nYou talk of wondr ous things you see,\nYou say the sun shines bright;\nI feel him warm, but how can he\nOr make it day or night ?\n \u2013 C. CIBBER\nDo you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we\ndie, we can light the life of a blind person.\nAbout 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be\ncured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal\ntransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the\nage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does\nnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?\n/square6Eye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those\noperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have\nhypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the\neye lens.  Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia.  Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant\nvision. The lower part is a convex lens.  It facilitates near vision.\n  These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with\ncontact lenses or through surgical interventions.\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

Y ou may note that a ray of light is entering from air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air . Hence it has bent away fr om nor mal. Compar e the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case \u2220D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of\ndeviation in the above activity and measure it.\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL ASS PRISM\nASS PRISMASS PRISM ASS PRISMASS PRISM\nYou must have seen and appr eciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow?

Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. Y ou might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct fr om the other . The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However , he could not get any mor e colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer\u2019s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formationSunlightRaindrop\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Science 168Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10\nAtmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nYou might have observed the appar ent random wavering or\nflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air\nrising above a fir e or a radiator . The air just above the fir e becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air . Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen thr ough the hot air , fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth\u2019s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further , this appar\nent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth\u2019s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers \u2013 the\nstar sometimes appears brighter , and at some other time, fainter , which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don\u2019t the planets twinkle? The p lanets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun\u2019s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon .Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 16910.6  SC ATTERING OF LIGHT\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever , its path becomes visible thr ough a colloidal solution wher e the\nsize of the particles is r elatively lar ger.\n10.6.1 T yndall Effect\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. V ery fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that \u2018danger\u2019 signal lights ar e red in colour .\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Science 170What y ou hav e learnt\n/square6The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its\nfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.\n/square6The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.
