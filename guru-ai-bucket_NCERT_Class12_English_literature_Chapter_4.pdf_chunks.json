["The Rattrap\nAbout the author\nSelma Lagerl\u00f6f (1858-1940) was a Swedish writer whose stories \nhave been translated into many languages. A universal theme runs through all of them \u2014 a belief that the essential goodness in a human being can be awakened through understanding and love. This story is set amidst the mines of Sweden, rich in iron ore, which figure large in the history and legends of that country. The story is told somewhat in the manner of a fairy tale.\nNotice these expressions in the text.Infer their meaning from the context.\n\uf097 \n keep body and soul together  \uf097  hunger gleamed in his eyes\n\uf097  plods along the road  \uf097  unwonted joy\n\uf097  impenetrable prison  \uf097  nodded a haughty consent\n\uf097  eased his way  \uf097  fallen into a line of thought  \n\uf097  things have gone downhill\nOnce upon a time there was a man who went around selling small rattraps of wire. He made them himself at odd moments, from the material he got by begging in the stores or at the big farms. But even so, the business was not especially profitable, so he had to resort to both begging and petty thievery to keep body and soul together. Even so, his clothes were in rags, his cheeks were sunken, and hunger gleamed in his eyes.\nNo one can imagine how sad and monotonous life can appear \nto such a vagabond, who plods along the road, left to his own meditations. But one day this man had fallen into a line of thought, which really seemed to him entertaining. He had naturally been thinking of his rattraps when suddenly he was struck by the idea that the whole world about him \u2014 the whole world with its lands and seas, its cities and villages \u2014 was nothing but a big rattrap. It had never existed for any other purpose than to set baits for people.

It became a cherished pastime of his, during many dreary ploddings, to think of people he knew who had let themselves be caught in the dangerous snare, and of others who were still circling around the bait.\nOne dark evening as he was trudging along the road he caught \nsight of a little gray cottage by the roadside, and he knocked on the door to ask shelter for the night. Nor was he refused. Instead of the sour faces which ordinarily met him, the owner, who was an old man without wife or child, was happy to get someone to talk to in his loneliness. Immediately he put the porridge pot on the fire and gave him supper; then he carved off such a big slice from his tobacco roll that it was enough both for the stranger\u2019s pipe and his own. Finally he got out an old pack of cards and played \u2018mjolis\u2019 with his guest until bedtime.\nThe old man was just as generous with his confidences as with \nhis porridge and tobacco. The guest was informed at once that in his days of prosperity his host had been a crofter at Ramsjo Ironworks and had worked on the land. Now that he was no longer able to do day labour, it was his cow which supported him. Yes, that bossy was extraordinary. She could give milk for the creamery every day, and last month he had received all of thirty kronor in payment.\nThe stranger must have seemed incredulous, for the old man got \nup and went to the window, took down a leather pouch which hung on a nail in the very window frame, and picked out three wrinkled ten-kronor bills. These he held up before the eyes of his guest, nodding knowingly, and then stuffed them back into the pouch.\nThe next day both men got up in good season. The crofter was \nin a hurry to milk his cow, and the other man probably thought he should not stay in bed when the head of the house had gotten up. They left the cottage at the same time. The crofter locked the door and put the key in his pocket. The man with the rattraps said good bye and thank you, and thereupon each went his own way...\nChap 4.indd   33 12/11/2024   11:19:34 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "34/Flamingo\nBut half an hour later the rattrap \npeddler stood again before the door. He \ndid not try to get in, however. He only went up to the window, smashed a pane, stuck in his hand, and got hold of the pouch with the thirty kronor. He took the money and thrust it into his own pocket. Then he hung the leather pouch very carefully back in its place and went away.\nAs he walked along with the money in \nhis pocket he felt quite pleased with his smartness. He realised, of course, that at first he dared not continue on the public highway, but must turn off the road, into the woods. During the first hours this caused him no difficulty. Later in the day it became worse, for it was a big and confusing forest which he had gotten into. He tried, to be sure, to walk in a definite direction, but the paths twisted back and forth so strangely! He walked and walked without coming to the end of the wood, and finally he realised that he had only been walking around in the same part of the forest. All at once he recalled his thoughts about the world and the rattrap. Now his own turn had come. He had let himself be fooled by a bait and had been caught. The whole forest, with its trunks and branches, its thickets and fallen logs, closed in upon him like an impenetrable prison from which he could never escape.\nIt was late in December. Darkness was already descending \nover the forest. This increased the danger, and increased also his gloom and despair. Finally he saw no way out, and he sank down on the ground, tired to death, thinking that his last moment had come. But just as he laid his head on the ground, he heard a sound\u2014a hard regular thumping. There was no doubt as to what that was. He raised himself. \u2018\u2018Those are the hammer strokes from an iron mill\u2019\u2019, he thought. \u2018\u2018There must be people near by\u2019\u2019. He summoned all his strength, got up, and staggered in the direction of  \nthe sound.\n1.

In \nthe summertime long lines of heavily loaded barges and scows slid down the canal, which led to a large inland lake, and in the wintertime the roads near the mill were black from all the coal dust which sifted down from the big charcoal crates.\nDuring one of the long dark evenings just before Christmas, the \nmaster smith and his helper sat in the dark forge near the furnace waiting for the pig iron, which had been put in the fire, to be ready to put on the anvil. Every now and then one of them got up to stir the glowing mass with a long iron bar, returning in a few moments, dripping with perspiration, though, as was the custom, he wore nothing but a long shirt and a pair of wooden shoes. \nAll the time there were many sounds to be heard in the forge. \nThe big bellows groaned and the burning coal cracked. The fire boy shovelled charcoal into the maw of the furnace with a great deal of clatter. Outside roared the waterfall, and a sharp north wind whipped the rain against the brick-tiled roof.\nIt was probably on account of all this noise that the blacksmith \ndid not notice that a man had opened the gate and entered the forge, until he stood close up to the furnace. \nSurely it was nothing unusual for poor vagabonds without any \nbetter shelter for the night to be attracted to the forge by the glow of light which escaped through the sooty panes, and to come in to warm themselves in front of the fire. The blacksmiths glanced only casually and indifferently at the intruder. He looked the way people of his type usually did, with a long beard, dirty, ragged, and with a bunch of rattraps dangling on his chest.\nHe asked permission to stay, and the master blacksmith nodded \na haughty consent without honouring him with a single word.\nThe tramp did not say anything, either. He had not come there \nto talk but only to warm himself and sleep.\nIn those days the Ramsj\u00f6 iron mill was owned by a very \nprominent ironmaster, whose greatest ambition was to ship out good iron to the market. He watched both night and day to see that the work was done as well as possible, and at this very moment he came into the forge on one of his nightly rounds of inspection.\nChap 4.indd   35 12/11/2024   11:19:34 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "36/Flamingo\nNaturally the first thing he saw was the tall ragamuffin who had \neased his way so close to the furnace that steam rose from his wet \nrags. The ironmaster did not follow the example of the blacksmiths, who had hardly deigned to look at the stranger. He walked close up to him, looked him over very carefully, then tore off his slouch hat to get a better view of his face.\n\u2018\u2018But of course it is you, Nils Olof!\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cHow you do look!\u201d\nThe man with the rattraps had never before seen the ironmaster \nat Ramsj\u00f6 and did not even know what his name was. But it \noccurred to him that if the fine gentleman thought he was an old acquaintance, he might perhaps throw him a couple of kronor. Therefore he did not want to undeceive him all at once.\n\u2018\u2018Yes, God knows things have gone downhill with me\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\u2018\u2018You should not have resigned from the regiment\u2019\u2019, said the \nironmaster. \u2018\u2018That was the mistake. If only I had still been in the \nservice at the time, it never would have happened. Well, now of course you will come home with me.\u2019\u2019\nTo go along up to the manor house and be received by the \nowner like an old regimental comrade \u2014 that, however, did not please the tramp.\n\u2018\u2018No, I couldn\u2019t think of it!\u2019\u2019 he said, looking quite alarmed.\nHe thought of the thirty kronor. To go up to the manor house \nwould be like throwing himself voluntarily into the lion\u2019s den. He \nonly wanted a chance to sleep here in the forge and then sneak away as inconspicuously as possible.\nThe ironmaster assumed that he felt embarrassed because of \nhis miserable clothing.\n\u2018\u2018Please don\u2019t think that I have such a fine home that you \ncannot show yourself there\u2019\u2019, He said... \u2018\u2018Elizabeth is dead, as you may already have heard. My boys are abroad, and there is no one at home except my oldest daughter and myself. We were just saying that it was too bad we didn\u2019t have any company for Christmas. Now come along with me and help us make the Christmas food disappear a little faster.\u201d\nBut the stranger said no, and no, and again no, and the ironmaster \nsaw that he must give in.\nChap 4.indd   36 12/11/2024   11:19:34 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Rattrap /37\n\u2018\u2018It looks as though Captain von \nStahle preferred to stay with you tonight, \nStjernstrom\u2019\u2019, he said to the master blacksmith, and turned on his heel.\nBut he laughed to himself as he went \naway, and the blacksmith, who knew him, understood very well that he had not said his last word.\nIt was not more than half an hour \nbefore they heard the sound of carriage wheels outside the forge, and a new guest came in, but this time it was not the ironmaster. He had sent his daughter, apparently hoping that she would have better powers of persuasion than he himself. \nShe entered, followed by a valet, carrying on his arm a big \nfur coat. She was not at all pretty, but seemed modest and quite shy. In the forge everything was just as it had been earlier in the evening. The master blacksmith and his apprentice still sat on their bench, and iron and charcoal still glowed in the furnace. The stranger had stretched himself out on the floor and lay with a piece of pig iron under his head and his hat pulled down over his eyes. As soon as the young girl caught sight of him, she went up and lifted his hat. The man was evidently used to sleeping with one eye open. He jumped up abruptly and seemed to be quite frightened.\n\u2018\u2018My name is Edla Willmansson,\u2019\u2019 said the young girl. \u2018\u2018My father \ncame home and said that you wanted to sleep here in the forge tonight, and then I asked permission to come and bring you home to us. I am so sorry, Captain, that you are having such a hard time.\u2019\u2019\nShe looked at him compassionately, with her heavy eyes, and \nthen she noticed that the man was afraid. \u2018\u2018Either he has stolen something or else he has escaped from, jail\u2019\u2019, she thought, and added quickly, \u201cYou may be sure, Captain, that you will be allowed to leave us just as freely as you came. Only please stay with us over Christmas Eve.\u2019\u2019\nShe said this in such a friendly manner that the rattrap peddler \nmust have felt confidence in her.\n1.

Last night he was naturally embarrassed. The tramp manners will fall away from him with the tramp clothes.\u201d\nJust as he said this the door opened and the stranger entered. \nYes, now he was truly clean and well dressed. The valet had bathed him, cut his hair, and shaved him. Moreover he was dressed in a good-looking suit of clothes which belonged to the ironmaster. He wore a white shirt and a starched collar and whole shoes. \nBut although his guest was now so well groomed, the \nironmaster did not seem pleased. He looked at him with puckered brow, and it was easy to understand that when he had seen the strange fellow in the uncertain reflection from the furnace he might have made a mistake, but that now, when he stood there \nChap 4.indd   38 12/11/2024   11:19:34 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Rattrap /39\nin broad daylight, it was impossible to mistake him for an old \nacquaintance.\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he thundered.\nThe stranger made no attempt to dissimulate. He saw at once \nthat the splendour had come to an end. \n\u201cIt is not my fault, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI never pretended to be \nanything but a poor trader, and I pleaded and begged to be allowed \nto stay in the forge. But no harm has been done. At worst I can put on my rags again and go away\u201d.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the ironmaster, hesitating a little, \u201cit was not quite \nhonest, either. You must admit that, and I should not be surprised if the sheriff would like to have something to say in the matter.\u201d \nThe tramp took a step forward and struck the table with his fist. \n\u201cNow I am going to tell you, Mr Ironmaster, how things are,\u201d \nhe said. \u201cThis whole world is nothing but a big rattrap. All the \ngood things that are offered to you are nothing but cheese rinds and bits of pork, set out to drag a poor fellow into trouble. And if the sheriff comes now and locks me up for this, then you, Mr Ironmaster, must remember that a day may come when you yourself may want to get a big piece of pork, and then you will get caught in the trap.\u201d\nThe ironmaster began to laugh.\n\u201cThat was not so badly said, my good fellow. Perhaps we should \nlet the sheriff alone on Christmas Eve. But now get out of here as \nfast as you can.\u201d\nBut just as the man was opening the door, the daughter said, \n\u201cI think he ought to stay with us today. I don\u2019t want him to go.\u201d And with that she went and closed the door.\n \u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d said the father.\nThe daughter stood there quite embarrassed and har\ndly knew \nwhat to answer. That morning she had felt so happy when she thought how homelike and Christmassy she was going to make things for the poor hungry wretch. She could not get away from the idea all at once, and that was why she had interceded for the vagabond.\nChap 4.indd   39 12/11/2024   11:19:34 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "40/Flamingo\n\u201cI am thinking of this stranger here,\u201d said the young girl. \n\u201cHe walks and walks the whole year long, and there is probably \nnot a single place in the whole country where he is welcome and can feel at home. Wherever he turns he is chased away. Always he is afraid of being arrested and cross-examined. I should like to have him enjoy a day of peace with us here \u2014 just one in the whole year.\u201d\nThe ironmaster mumbled something in his beard. He could not \nbring himself to oppose her.\n\u201cIt was all a mistake, of course,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut anyway I \ndon\u2019t think we ought to chase away a human being whom we have asked to come here, and to whom we have promised Christmas cheer.\u201d\n\u201cYou do preach worse than a parson,\u201d said the ironmaster. \u201cI \nonly hope you won\u2019t have to regret this.\u201d \nThe young girl took the stranger by the hand and led him up \nto the table.\n\u201cNow sit down and eat,\u201d she said, for she could see that her \nfather had given in.\nThe man with the rattraps said not a word; he only sat down \nand helped himself to the food. Time after time he looked at the young girl who had interceded for him. Why had she done it? What could the crazy idea be?\nAfter that, Christmas Eve at Ramsj\u00f6 passed just as it always \nhad. The stranger did not cause any trouble because he did nothing but sleep. The whole forenoon he lay on the sofa in one of the guest rooms and slept at one stretch. At noon they woke him up so that he could have his share of the good Christmas fare, but after that he slept again. It seemed as though for many years he had not been able to sleep as quietly and safely as here at Ramsj\u00f6.\nIn the evening, when the Christmas tree was lighted, they \nwoke him up again, and he stood for a while in the drawing room, blinking as though the candlelight hurt him, but after that he disappeared again. Two hours later he was aroused once more. He then had to go down into the dining room and eat the Christmas fish and porridge.\nChap 4.indd   40 12/11/2024   11:19:34 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Rattrap /41\nAs soon as they got up from the table he went around to \neach one present and said thank you and good night, but when \nhe came to the young girl she gave him to understand that it was her father\u2019s intention that the suit which he wore was to be a Christmas present \u2014 he did not have to return it; and if he wanted to spend next Christmas Eve in a place where he could rest in peace, and be sure that no evil would befall him, he would be welcomed back again.\nThe man with the rattraps did not \nanswer anything to this.
