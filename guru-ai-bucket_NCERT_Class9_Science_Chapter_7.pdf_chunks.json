["In everyday life, we see some objects at r est\nand others in motion. Bir ds fly, fish swim,\nblood flows through veins and arteries, and\ncars move. Atoms, molecules, planets, stars\nand galaxies ar e all in motion. W e often\nperceive an object to be in motion when its\nposition changes with time. However , ther e\nare situations wher e the motion is inferr ed\nthrough indir ect evidences. For example, we\ninfer the motion of air by observing the\nmovement of dust and the movement of leaves\nand branches of tr ees. What causes the\nphenomena of sunrise, sunset and changing\nof seasons? Is it due to the motion of the\nearth? If it is true, why don\u2019t we dir ectly\nperceive the motion of the earth?\nAn object may appear to be moving for\none person and stationary for some other .

Let us\nunderstand this by an example. Let us\nassume that a school in a village is 2 km north\nof the railway station. W e have specified the\nposition of the school with r espect to the\nrailway station. In this example, the railway\nstation is the r eference point.

W e shall first lear n to\ndescribe this by an example. Consider the\nmotion of an object moving along a straight\npath. The object starts its jour ney fr om O\nwhich is tr eated as its r eference point\n(Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position\nof the object at different instants. At first, the\nobject moves through C and B and reaches A.\nThen it moves back along the same path and\nreaches C through B.\nare used to describe the overall motion of an\nobject and to locate its final position with\nreference to its initial position at a given time.\nActivity ______________ 7.3\n\u2022Take a metre scale and a long rope.\n\u2022Walk fr om one cor ner of a basket-ball\ncourt to its oppposite cor ner along its\nsides.\n\u2022Measur e the distance cover ed by you\nand magnitude of the displacement.\n\u2022What dif ference would you notice\nbetween the two in this case?\nActivity ______________ 7.4\n\u2022Automobiles are fitted with a device\nthat shows the distance travelled. Such\na device is known as an odometer . A\ncar is driven fr om Bhubaneshwar to\nNew Delhi. The dif ference between the\nfinal r eading and the initial r eading of\nthe odometer is 1850 km.\n\u2022Find the magnitude of the displacement\nbetween Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi\nby using the Road Map of India.The total path length covered by the object\nis OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km.\nThis is the distance cover ed by the object. T o\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the dir ection of\nmotion. Ther e are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. Fr om this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object fr om the initial\nposition O? This dif ference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject fr om O to C thr ough A. The shortest\ndistance measur ed from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For\nmotion of the object from O to A,  the distance\ncovered is 60 km  and the magnitude of\ndisplacement is also 60 km. During its motion\nfrom O to A and back to B, the distance coveredFig. 7.1:  Positions of an object on a straight line path= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude\nof displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude\nof displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path\nlength (85 km). Further , we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zer o. However , the distance\ncovered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +\n60 km = 120 km.

As the object covers equal distances\nin equal intervals of time, it is said to be in\nunifor m motion. The time interval in this\nmotion should be small. In our day-to-day\nlife, we come acr oss motions wher e objects\ncover unequal distances in equal intervals\nof time, for example, when a car is moving\non a cr owded str eet or a person is jogging\nin a park.

If\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h\u20131 in Fig. 7.2(a)\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\nDifferent objects may take dif ferent\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\nSome of them move fast and some move\nslowly.  The rate at which objects move can\nbe dif ferent. Also, dif fer\nent objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is r eferred to as\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metr e per\nsecond. This is r epresented by the symbol\nm s\u20131 or m/s. The other units of speed include\ncentimetr e per second (cm s\u20131) and kilometr e\nper hour (km h\u20131). To specify the speed of an\nobject, we r equir e only its magnitude. The\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\nmost cases, objects will be in non-uniform\nmotion. Ther efore, we describe the rate of\nmotion of such objects in ter ms of their\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\naverage speed = Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\nits speed v is,\nv = s\nt(7.1)\nLet us understand this by an example. A\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\naverage speed is 50 km h\u20131. The car might\nnot have travelled at 50 km h\u20131 all the time.\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\nsometimes slower than this.\nExample 7.1  An object travels 16 m in 4 s\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\nthe average speed of the object?\nSolution:\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 sAverage speed =  Total distance travelled\nTotal time taken\n= 32 m\n6 s= 5.33 m s\u20131\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\nis 5.33 m s\u20131.\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\nThe rate of motion of an object can be mor e\ncompr ehensive if we specify its dir ection of\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\ndefinite dir ection. The velocity of an object\ncan be unifor m or variable. It can be changed\nby changing the object\u2019s speed, dir ection of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan expr ess the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in ter ms of average velocity. It is\ncalculated in the same way as we calculate\naverage speed.\nIn case the velocity of the object is\nchanging at a unifor m rate, then average\nvelocity is given by the arithmetic mean of\ninitial velocity and final velocity for a given\nperiod of time. That is,\naverage velocity = initialvelocity + finalvelocity\n2\nMathematically, v av  = u + v\n2(7.2)\nwhere vav is the average velocity, u is the initial\nvelocity and v is the final velocity of the object.\nSpeed and velocity have the same units,\nthat is, m s\u20131 or m/s.\nActivity ______________ 7.6\n\u2022Measure the time it takes you to walk\nfrom your house to your bus stop or\nthe school.

In this case, the change in velocity\nof the object for any time interval is zero.\nHowever , in non-uniform motion, velocity\nvaries with time.

This shows that thedistance travelled by the object is directly\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate.

For convenience, a\nset of three such equations are given below:\nv=u + at (7.5)\ns=ut + \u00bd at2(7.6)\n2 as = v2 \u2013 u2(7.7)\nwhere u is the initial velocity of the object which\nmoves with uniform acceleration a for time t,\nv is the final velocity, and s is the distance\ntravelled by the object in time t. Eq. (7.5)\ndescribes the velocity-time relation and Eq.\n(7.6) represents the position-time relation. Eq.\n(7.7), which represents the relation between the\nposition and the velocity, can be obtained from\nEqs. (7.5) and (7.6) by eliminating t.

The change in\nthe velocity could be due to change in its\nmagnitude or the direction of the motion or\nboth. Can you think of an example when an\nobject does not change its magnitude of\nvelocity but only its direction of motion?straight parts AB, BC, CD and DA of the track.\nIn order to keep himself on track, he quickly\nchanges his speed at the corners. How many\ntimes will the athlete have to change his\ndirection of motion, while he completes one\nround? It is clear that to move in a rectangular\ntrack once, he has to change his direction of\nmotion four times.\nNow, suppose instead of a rectangular\ntrack, the athlete is running along a\nhexagonal shaped path ABCDEF , as shown\nin Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will\nhave to change his direction six times while\nhe  completes one round. What if the track\nwas not a hexagon but a regular octagon,\nwith eight equal sides as shown by\nABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that\nas the number of sides of the track increases\nthe athelete has to take turns more and more\noften. What would happen to the shape of the\ntrack as we go on increasing the number of\nsides indefinitely? If you do this you will\nnotice that the shape of the track approaches\nthe shape of a circle and the length of each of\nthe sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete\nmoves with a velocity of constant magnitude\nalong the circular path, the only change in\nhis velocity is due to the change in the\ndirection of motion. The motion of the athlete\nmoving along a circular path is, therefore, an\nexample of an accelerated moti on.\nWe know  that the cir cumfer ence of a cir cle\nof radius r is given by  \u03c02 r. If the athlete takes\nt seconds to go once around the circular path\nof radius r, the speed v is given by\n\u03c02 rv =\nt\n(7.8)\nWhen an object moves in a circular path\nwith uniform speed, its motion is called\nuniform circular motion.(a) Rectangular track (b) Hexagonal track\n(d) A cir cular track (c) Octagonal shaped track\nFig. 7.8: The motion of an athlete along closed tracks\nof different shapes.\nLet us consider an example of the motion\nof a body along a closed path.

Move\nthe stone to describe a circular path\nwith constant speed by holding the\nthread at the other end, as shown in\nFig. 7.9.If you carefully note, on being released\nthe stone moves along a straight line\ntangential to the circular path. This is\nbecause once the stone is released, it\ncontinues to move along the direction it has\nbeen moving at that instant. This shows that\nthe direction of motion changed at every point\nwhen the stone was moving along the circular\npath.\nWhen an athlete throws a hammer or a\ndiscus in a sports meet, he/she holds the\nhammer or the discus in his/her hand and\ngives it a circular motion by rotating his/\nher own body.
